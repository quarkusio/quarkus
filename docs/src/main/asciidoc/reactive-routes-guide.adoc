= Using Reactive Routes

Reactive routes propose an alternative approach to implement HTTP endpoints where you declare and chain _routes_.
This approach became very popular in the JavaScript world, with frameworks like Express.Js or Hapi.
Quarkus also offers the possibility to use reactive routes.
You can implement REST API with routes only or combine them with JAX-RS resources and servlets.

The code presented in this guide is available in this https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts[Github repository] under the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts/tree/master/using-reactive-routes[`using-reactive-routes` directory]

== Quarkus HTTP

Before going further, let's have a look at the HTTP layer of Quarkus.
Quarkus HTTP support is based on a non-blocking and reactive engine (Eclipse Vert.x and Netty).
All the HTTP requests your application receive are handled by _event loops_ (IO Thread) and then are routed towards the code that manages the request.
Depending on the destination, it can invoke the code managing the request on a worker thread (Servlet, Jax-RS) or use the IO Thread (reactive route).
Note that because of this, a reactive route must be non-blocking or explicitly declare its blocking nature (which would result by being called on a worker thread).

== Declaring reactive routes

The first way to use reactive routes is to use the `@Route` annotation.
To have access to this annotation, you need to add the `quarkus-vertx-web` extension:

In your `pom.xml` file, add:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-vertx-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Then in a _bean_, you can use the `@Route` annotation as follows:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.quarkus.sample;

import io.quarkus.vertx.web.Route;
import io.quarkus.vertx.web.RoutingExchange;
import io.vertx.core.http.HttpMethod;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class MyDeclarativeRoutes {


    @Route(path = "/", methods = HttpMethod.GET)
    public void handle(RoutingContext rc) {
        rc.response().end("hello");
    }

    @Route(path = "/hello", methods = HttpMethod.GET)
    public void greetings(RoutingContext rc) {
        String name = rc.request().getParam("name");
        if (name == null) {
            name = "world";
        }
        rc.response().end("hello " + name);
    }
}
----

The `@Route` annotation indicates that the method is a reactive route.
Again, by default, the code contained in the method must not block.
The method gets a https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/ext/web/RoutingContext.html[`RoutingContext`] as a parameter.
From the `RoutingContext` you can retrieve the HTTP request (using `request()`) and write the response using `response().end(...)`.

More details about using the `RoutingContext` is available in the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/[Vert.x Web documentation].

The `@Route` annotation allows to configure:

* The `path` - using the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_capturing_path_parameters[Vert.x Web format]
* The `regex` - when `path` is not used.
See https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_routing_with_regular_expressions[for more details]
* The `methods` - the HTTP verb triggering the route such as `GET`, `POST`...
* The `type` - it can be _normal_ (non-blocking), _blocking_ (method dispatched on a worker thread), or _failure_ to indicate that this route is called on failures
* The `order` - the order of the route when several routes are involved in handling the incoming request.
Must be positive for regular user routes.
* The produced and consumed mime types using `produces`, and `consumes`

For instance, you can declare a blocking route as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Route(methods = HttpMethod.POST, path = "/post", type = Route.HandlerType.BLOCKING)
public void blocking(RoutingContext rc) {
    // ...
}
----

You can also declare several routes for a single method using `@Routes`:

[source,java]
----
@Route.Routes({
    @Route(path = "/first"),
    @Route(path = "/second")
})
public void route(RoutingContext rc) {
    // ...
}
----

Each route can use different paths, methods...

== Using the Vert.x Web Router

You can also register your route directly on the _HTTP routing layer_ by registering routes directly on the `Router` object.
To retrieve the `Router` instance at startup:

[source,java]
----
public void init(@Observes Router router) {
    router.get("/my-route").handler(rc -> rc.response().end("Hello from my route"));
}
----

Check the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_basic_vert_x_web_concepts[Vert.x Web documentation] to know more about the route registration, options, and available handlers.


[NOTE]
====
`Router` access is provided by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.
If you use `quarkus-reasteasy` or `quarkus-vertx-web`, the extension will be added automatically.
====

== Intercepting HTTP requests

You can also register filters that would intercept incoming HTTP requests.
Note that these filters are also applied for servlets, JAX-RS resources, and reactive routes.

For example, the following code snippet registers a filter adding an HTTP header:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.quarkus.sample;

import io.quarkus.vertx.http.runtime.filters.Filters;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;

@ApplicationScoped
public class MyFilter {

    public void registerMyFilter(@Observes Filters filters) {
        filters.register(rc -> {
            rc.response().putHeader("X-Header", "intercepting the request");
            rc.next();
        }, 100);
    }
}
----

The registration is done using `Filters.register`.
The first parameter is the handler receiving the `RoutingContext`.
The handler is likely required to call the `next()` method to continue to chain.
The second parameter is the priority used to sort the filters Highest priority are called first.

== Conclusion

This guide has introduced how you can use reactive routes to define HTTP endpoint.
It also describes the structure of the Quarkus HTTP layer and how to write filters.
