= Quarkus - Command Mode Applications

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This reference covers how to write applications that run and then exit.

== Writing Command Mode Applications

There are two different approaches that can be used to implement applications
that exit.

. Implement `QuarkusApplication` and have Quarkus run this method automatically
. Implement `QuarkusApplication` and a Java main method, and use the Java main method to launch Quarkus

In this document the `QuarkusApplication` instance is referred to as the application main,
and a class with a Java main method is the Java main.

The simplest possible command mode application might appear as follows:

[source,java]
----
import io.quarkus.runtime.QuarkusApplication;
import io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.QuarkusMain;

@QuarkusMain    // <1>
public class HelloWorldMain implements QuarkusApplication {
  @Override
  public int run(String... args) throws Exception {   // <2>
    System.out.println("Hello World");
    return 10;
 }
}
----
<1> The `@QuarkusMain` annotation tells Quarkus that this is the main entry point.
<2> The `run` method is invoked once Quarkus starts, and the application stops when it finishes.

If we want to use a Java main to run the application main it would look like:

[source,java]
----
import io.quarkus.runtime.Quarkus;
import io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.QuarkusMain;

@QuarkusMain
public class JavaMain {

    public static void main(String... args) {
        Quarkus.run(HelloWorldMain.class, args);
    }
}
----

This is effectively the same as running the `HelloWorldMain` application main directly, but has the advantage it can
be run from the IDE.

WARNING: It is recommended that a Java main perform very little logic, and just
launch the application main. In development mode the Java main will run in a
different ClassLoader to the main application, so may not behave as you would
expect.

=== Multiple Main Methods

It is possible to have multiple main methods in an application, and select between them at build time.
The `@QuarkusMain` annotation takes an optional 'name' parameter, and this can be used to select the
main to run using the `quarkus.package.main-class` build time configuration option. If you don't want
to use annotations this can also be used to specify the fully qualified name of a main class.

By default the `@QuarkusMain` with no name (i.e. the empty string) will be used, and if it is not present
and `quarkus.package.main-class` is not specified then Quarkus will automatically generate a main class
that just runs the application.

NOTE: The `name` of `@QuarkusMain` must be unique (including the default of the empty string). If you
have multiple `@QuarkusMain` annotations in your application the build will fail if the names are not
unique.


=== The command mode lifecycle

When running a command mode application the basic lifecycle is as follows:

. Start Quarkus
. Run the `QuarkusApplication` main method
. Shut down Quarkus and exit the JVM after the main method returns

Shutdown is always initiated by the application main thread returning. If you want to run some logic on startup,
and then run like a normal application (i.e. not exit) then you should call `Quarkus.waitForExit` from the main
thread (A non-command mode application is essentially just running an application that just calls `waitForExit`).

If you want to shut down a running application and you are not in the main thread then you should call `Quarkus.asyncExit`
in order to unblock the main thread and initiate the shutdown process.
