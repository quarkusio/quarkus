= Automatic service registration with SmallRye Stork for Quarkus

This guide explains how to enable automatic registration and deregistration of a Quarkus application using SmallRye Stork and Consul, with minimal or no configuration.

== Overview

SmallRye Stork supports service registration backends like Consul and Eureka.
Traditionally, developers link:{quickstarts-tree-url}/stork-programmatic-custom-registration-quickstart[had to explicitly configure and manually register] their service instances using code.
With this feature, Quarkus applications can automatically register with a supported registry (e.g., Consul) during startup and deregister during shutdown â€” without writing boilerplate code.

**IMPORTANT**: Note that automatic registration is possible **only** for built-in registrars such as Consul, Eureka, and Static.
If you're using a custom registrar, registration must still be handled programmatically.
Check the `stork-programmatic-custom-registration-quickstart` link:{quickstarts-tree-url}/stork-programmatic-custom-registration-quickstart[directory] example for this use case.

This integration minimizes configuration effort and adheres to Quarkus' philosophy of doing as much as possible at build time.

== How it works

When the application starts and the `stork-service-registration-consul` dependency, besides the `quarkus-smallrye-stork`, is present:

- Quarkus performs a build-time check for registration configuration.
- If valid configuration is detected (or can be inferred), registration metadata is generated.
- The application registers itself automatically using the detected or configured IP address and port.
- During shutdown, the service is automatically deregistered.

The solution is located in the `stork-automatic-consul-registration-quickstart` link:{quickstarts-tree-url}/stork-automatic-consul-registration-quickstart[directory].


== Use cases/configuration options

The registration system uses sensible defaults but also allows for fine-grained control per service.

=== Case 1: implicit configuration

No configuration required at all:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.stork</groupId>
  <artifactId>stork-service-registration-consul</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Quarkus automatically uses:

- Application name
- Detected IP address
- HTTP port

The service is registered and unregistered automatically.

=== Case 2: minimal explicit configuration

Only override what's necessary:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.stork.my-service.service-registrar.ip-address=192.168.0.42
----

No `quarkus.stork.my-service.service-registrar.type` is needed because there's only one registrar configuration in `application.properties`.

=== Case 3: multiple services registrars

When multiple services are configured, you must specify the `quarkus.stork.<service-name>.service-registrar.typetype`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.stork.red-service.service-registrar.type=consul
quarkus.stork.red-service.service-registrar.port=8083

quarkus.stork.blue-service.service-registrar.type=consul
quarkus.stork.blue-service.service-registrar.port=8084
----

=== Case 4: disabling registration

Automatic registration is enabled by default. If you want to disable registration, you can do it per service using the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.stork.red-service.service-registrar.enabled=false
----

=== Case 5: advanced health check configuration

Customize how Consul polls service health:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.stork.my-service.service-registrar.parameters.health-check-url=/q/health/live
quarkus.stork.my-service.service-registrar.parameters.health-check-interval=10s
quarkus.stork.my-service.service-registrar.parameters.health-check-deregister-after=1m
----

=== Case 6: static IP and port

Useful when behind a proxy or in production with known IPs:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.stork.my-service.service-registrar.ip-address=203.0.113.25
quarkus.stork.my-service.service-registrar.port=80
----

== IP detection

By default, Quarkus attempts to determine the IP address using the first available, non-loopback network interface.
If this fails, it falls back to `localhost`.

Note that in Docker/Kubernetes environments, this detection may result in internal IPs that are not externally reachable.
In such cases, it's recommended to explicitly set the IP and port.

== Summary

- Minimal or zero config to get service registration working
- Seamless integration with Consul via build-time processing
- Per-service override support
- Auto-deregistration on shutdown
- Easily extendable to support other backends
