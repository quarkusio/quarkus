# Maven Plugin Test Fixes - Mojo Rules Compliance

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Dependency Scopes (Mojo Rules)
- Changed all Maven dependencies to `provided` scope as required by Maven plugin conventions
- This eliminates the warnings about incorrect dependency scopes

### 2. Test Framework Alignment  
- Converted from JUnit 5 + Mockito to JUnit 4 with Maven Plugin Testing Harness
- Removed all Mockito dependencies and mocking
- Used proper `MojoRule` and `AbstractMojoTestCase` patterns

### 3. Compilation Fixes
- Fixed missing `readMavenProject()` method calls
- Fixed missing `getContainer().getLogger()` method calls  
- Fixed constructor parameter mismatches
- Fixed ambiguous `assertEquals()` calls

## Current State
- ✅ All compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Maven dependency scopes follow Mojo rules
- ✅ Tests use proper Maven Plugin Testing Harness
- ⚠️ Some test assertions fail because test setup needs real Maven context

## Test Status
- **Compiling**: ✅ All 7 test files compile successfully
- **Passing**: 65/76 tests pass
- **Failing**: 11 tests fail due to null Maven lifecycle context in test environment

The compilation issues have been fully resolved according to Mojo rules. The remaining test failures are logical/runtime issues, not compilation problems.
