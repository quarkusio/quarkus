= Context Propagation in Quarkus

include::./attributes.adoc[]

Traditional blocking code uses link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html[`ThreadLocal`]
 variables to store contextual objects in order to avoid
passing them as parameters everywhere. Many Quarkus extensions require those contextual objects to operate
properly: link:rest-json[RESTEasy], link:cdi-reference[ArC] and link:transaction[Transaction]
for example.

If you write reactive/async code, you have to cut your work into a pipeline of code blocks that get executed
"later", and in practice after the method you defined them in have returned. As such, `try/finally` blocks
as well as `ThreadLocal` variables stop working, because your reactive code gets executed in another thread,
after the caller ran its `finally` block.

link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-context-propagation[MicroProfile Context Propagation] was made to
make those Quarkus extensions work properly in reactive/async settings. It works by capturing those contextual
values that used to be in thread-locals, and restoring them when your code is called.

== Setting it up

If you are using link:http://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny[Mutiny] (the `quarkus-mutiny` extension), you just need to add the
the `quarkus-smallrye-context-propagation` extension to enable context propagation.

In other words, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <!-- Mutiny and RestEasy support extensions if not already included -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-mutiny</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy-mutiny</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Context Propagation extension -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-context-propagation</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

With this, you will get context propagation for ArC, RESTEasy and transactions, if you are using them.

== Usage example with Mutiny

[TIP]
.Mutiny
====
This section uses Mutiny reactive types, if you're not familiar with them, read the link:getting-started-reactive#mutiny[Getting Started with Reactive guide] first.
====

Let's write a REST endpoint that reads the next 3 items from a link:kafka[Kafka topic], stores them in a database using
link:hibernate-orm-panache[Hibernate ORM with Panache] (all in the same transaction) before returning
them to the client, you can do it like this:

[source,java]
----
    // Get the prices stream
    @Inject
    @Channel("prices") Publisher<Double> prices;

    @Transactional
    @GET
    @Path("/prices")
    @Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
    @SseElementType(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public Publisher<Double> prices() {
        // get the next three prices from the price stream
        return Multi.createFrom().publisher(prices)
                .transform().byTakingFirstItems(3)
                .map(price -> {
                    // store each price before we send them
                    Price priceEntity = new Price();
                    priceEntity.value = price;
                    // here we are all in the same transaction
                    // thanks to context propagation
                    priceEntity.persist();
                    return price;
                    // the transaction is committed once the stream completes
                });
    }
----

Notice that thanks to Mutiny support for context propagation, this works out of the box.
The 3 items are persisted using the same transaction and this transaction is committed when the stream completes.

== Usage example for `CompletionStage`

If you are using link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletionStage.html[`CompletionStage`]
you need manual context propagation. You can do that by injecting a `ThreadContext`
or `ManagedExecutor` that will propagate every context. For example, here we use the link:vertx[Vert.x Web Client]
to get the list of Star Wars people, then store them in the database using
link:hibernate-orm-panache[Hibernate ORM with Panache] (all in the same transaction) before returning
them to the client as JSON using link:rest-json[JSON-B or Jackson]:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject ThreadContext threadContext;
    @Inject ManagedExecutor managedExecutor;
    @Inject Vertx vertx;

    @Transactional
    @GET
    @Path("/people")
    public CompletionStage<List<Person>> people() throws SystemException {
        // Create a REST client to the Star Wars API
        WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx,
                         new WebClientOptions()
                          .setDefaultHost("swapi.dev")
                          .setDefaultPort(443)
                          .setSsl(true));
        // get the list of Star Wars people, with context capture
        return threadContext.withContextCapture(client.get("/api/people/").send())
                .thenApplyAsync(response -> {
                    JsonObject json = response.bodyAsJsonObject();
                    List<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>(json.getInteger("count"));
                    // Store them in the DB
                    // Note that we're still in the same transaction as the outer method
                    for (Object element : json.getJsonArray("results")) {
                        Person person = new Person();
                        person.name = ((JsonObject) element).getString("name");
                        person.persist();
                        persons.add(person);
                    }
                    return persons;
                }, managedExecutor);
    }
----

Using `ThreadContext` or `ManagedExecutor` you can wrap most useful functional types and `CompletionStage`
in order to get context propagated.

[NOTE]
====
The injected `ManagedExecutor` uses the Quarkus thread pool.

== Adding support for RxJava2

You need to include the following modules to get RxJava2 support:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <!-- Automatic context propagation for RxJava2 -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.smallrye</groupId>
        <artifactId>smallrye-context-propagation-propagators-rxjava2</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- 
    Required if you want transactions extended to the end of methods returning
    an RxJava2 type.
     -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
        <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-converter-rxjava2</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Required if you return RxJava2 types from your REST endpoints -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.resteasy</groupId>
        <artifactId>resteasy-rxjava2</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
