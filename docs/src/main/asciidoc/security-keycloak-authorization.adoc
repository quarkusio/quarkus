= Using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Keycloak to centralize authorization
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:diataxis-type: howto
:categories: security
:keywords: sso oidc security keycloak
:topics: security,authentication,authorization,keycloak,sso,oidc
:extensions: io.quarkus:quarkus-oidc,io.quarkus:quarkus-keycloak-authorization

Learn how to enable bearer token authorization in your Quarkus application using link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[Keycloak Authorization Services] for secure access to protected resources.

The `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` extension relies on `quarkus-oidc`.
It includes a policy enforcer that regulates access to secured resources.
Access is governed by permissions set in Keycloak.
Currently, this extension is compatible solely with Quarkus xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc[OIDC service applications].

It provides a flexible and dynamic authorization capability based on Resource-Based Access Control.

Rather than explicitly enforcing access through specific mechanisms such as role-based access control (RBAC), `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` determines request permissions based on resource attributes such as name, identifier, or Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
This process involves sending a `quarkus-oidc`-verified bearer access token to Keycloak Authorization Services for an authorization decision.

Use `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` only if you work with Keycloak and have Keycloak Authorization Services enabled to make authorization decisions.
Use `quarkus-oidc` if you do not work with Keycloak or work with Keycloak but do not have its Keycloak Authorization Services enabled to make authorization decisions.

By shifting authorization responsibilities outside your application, you enhance security through various access control methods while eliminating the need for frequent re-deployments whenever security needs evolve.
In this case, Keycloak acts as a centralized authorization hub, managing your protected resources and their corresponding permissions effectively.

For more information, see the xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc[OIDC Bearer token authentication] guide.
It is important to realize that the Bearer token authentication mechanism does the authentication and creates a security identity.
Meanwhile, the `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` extension applies a Keycloak Authorization Policy to this identity based on the current request path and other policy settings.

For more information, see https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_enforcer_overview[Keycloak Authorization Services documentation].

== Prerequisites

:prerequisites-docker:
include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq tool]
* https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak]

== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple microservice that offers two endpoints:

* `/api/users/me`
* `/api/admin`

These endpoints are protected.
Access is granted only when a client sends a bearer token with the request.
This token must be valid, having a correct signature, expiration date, and audience.
Additionally, the microservice must trust the token.

The bearer token is issued by a Keycloak server and represents the subject for which the token was issued.
For being an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, the token also references the client acting on behalf of the user.

The `/api/users/me` endpoint can be accessed by any user with a valid token.
As a response, it returns a JSON document with details about the user obtained from the information carried on the token.
This endpoint is protected with RBAC, and only users granted with the `user` role can access this endpoint.

The `/api/admin` endpoint is protected with RBAC, and only users granted the `admin` role can access it.

This is a very simple example of using RBAC policies to govern access to your resources.
However, Keycloak supports other policies that you can use to perform even more fine-grained access control.
By using this example, you'll see that your application is completely decoupled from your authorization policies, with enforcement purely based on the accessed resource.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is in the `security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart` link:{quickstarts-tree-url}/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the project

First, we need a new project.
Create a new project with the following command:

:create-app-artifact-id: security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart
:create-app-extensions: oidc,keycloak-authorization,resteasy-reactive-jackson
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

This command generates a project, importing the `keycloak-authorization` extension.
This extension implements a Keycloak Adapter for Quarkus applications and provides all the necessary capabilities to integrate with a Keycloak server and perform bearer token authorization.

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `oidc` and `keycloak-authorization` extensions
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

:add-extension-extensions: oidc,keycloak-authorization
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

This adds the following dependencies to your build file:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-keycloak-authorization</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-oidc")
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-keycloak-authorization")
----

Let's start by implementing the `/api/users/me` endpoint.
As you can see in the following source code, it is a regular Jakarta REST resource:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.keycloak.authorization;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

import org.jboss.resteasy.reactive.NoCache;

import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;

@Path("/api/users")
public class UsersResource {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity identity;

    @GET
    @Path("/me")
    @NoCache
    public User me() {
        return new User(identity);
    }

    public static class User {

        private final String userName;

        User(SecurityIdentity identity) {
            this.userName = identity.getPrincipal().getName();
        }

        public String getUserName() {
            return userName;
        }
    }
}
----

The source code for the `/api/admin` endpoint is also very simple:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.keycloak.authorization;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/api/admin")
@Authenticated
public class AdminResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String admin() {
        return "granted";
    }
}
----

Be aware that we have not defined annotations such as `@RolesAllowed` to explicitly enforce access to a resource.
Instead, the extension is responsible for mapping the URIs of the protected resources in Keycloak and evaluating the permissions accordingly, granting or denying access depending on the permissions granted by Keycloak.

=== Configuring the application

The OpenID Connect extension allows you to define the adapter configuration by using the `application.properties` file, which is usually located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

[source,properties]
----
# OIDC Configuration
%prod.quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://localhost:8543/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=backend-service
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.tls.verification=none

# Enable Policy Enforcement
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.enable=true

# Tell Dev Services for Keycloak to import the realm file
# This property is not effective when running the application in JVM or native modes
quarkus.keycloak.devservices.realm-path=quarkus-realm.json
----

NOTE: Adding a `%prod.` profile prefix to `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` ensures that Dev Services for Keycloak launches a container for you when the application is run in dev mode.
For more information, see the <<keycloak-dev-mode,Running the application in Dev mode>> section.

NOTE: By default, applications that use the `quarkus-oidc` extension are marked as a `service` type application (see `quarkus.oidc.application-type`).
This extension also supports only  `web-app` type applications but only if the access token returned as part of the authorization code grant response is marked as a source of roles: `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken` (`web-app` type applications check ID token roles by default).

== Starting and configuring the Keycloak server

NOTE: Do not start the Keycloak server when you run the application in dev mode.
Dev Services for Keycloak launches a container.
For more information, see the <<keycloak-dev-mode,Running the application in Dev mode>> section.

To start a Keycloak server, use the following Docker command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin -p 8543:8443 -v "$(pwd)"/config/keycloak-keystore.jks:/etc/keycloak-keystore.jks quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:{keycloak.version} start  --hostname-strict=false --https-key-store-file=/etc/keycloak-keystore.jks
----

where `keycloak.version` must be `23.0.0` or later and the `keycloak-keystore.jks` can be found in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts/blob/main/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart/config/keycloak-keystore.jks[quarkus-quickstarts/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart/config].

Try to access your Keycloak server at https://localhost:8543[localhost:8543].

To access the Keycloak Administration Console, log in as the `admin` user.
The username and password are both `admin`.

Import the link:{quickstarts-tree-url}/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] to create a new realm.
For more details, see the Keycloak documentation about how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_create-realm[create a new realm].

After importing the realm you can see the resource permissions:

image::keycloak-authorization-permissions.png[alt=Keycloak Authorization Permissions,role="center"]

It explains why the endpoint has no `@RolesAllowed` annotations - the resource access permissions are set directly in Keycloak.

[[keycloak-dev-mode]]
== Running the application in dev mode

To run the application in dev mode, use:

include::{includes}/devtools/dev.adoc[]

xref:security-openid-connect-dev-services.adoc[Dev Services for Keycloak] launches a Keycloak container and imports a `quarkus-realm.json`.

Open a xref:dev-ui.adoc[Dev UI] available at http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui[/q/dev-ui] and click a `Provider: Keycloak` link in an `OpenID Connect` `Dev UI` card.

When asked to log in to a `Single Page Application` provided by `OpenID Connect Dev UI`:

 * Log in as `alice` (password: `alice`), who only has a `User Permission` to access the `/api/users/me` resource:
 ** Access `/api/admin`, which returns `403`.
 ** Access `/api/users/me`, which returns `200`.
 * Log out and log in as `admin` (password: `admin`), who has both `Admin Permission` to access the `/api/admin` resource and `User Permission` to access the `/api/users/me` resource:
 ** Access `/api/admin`, which returns `200`.
 ** Access `/api/users/me`, which returns `200`.

If you have started xref:security-openid-connect-dev-services.adoc[Dev Services for Keycloak] without importing a realm file such as link:{quickstarts-tree-url}/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[quarkus-realm.json] that is already configured to support Keycloak Authorization, create a default `quarkus` realm without Keycloak authorization policies.
In this case, you must select the `Keycloak Admin` link in the `OpenId Connect` Dev UI card and configure link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[Keycloak Authorization Services] in the default `quarkus` realm.

The `Keycloak Admin` link is easy to find in Dev UI:

image::dev-ui-oidc-keycloak-card.png[alt=Dev UI OpenID Connect Card,role="center"]

When logging into the Keycloak admin console, the username and password are both `admin`.

If your application uses Keycloak authorization configured with link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_policy_js[JavaScript policies] that are deployed in a JAR file, you can set up Dev Services for Keycloak to transfer this archive to the Keycloak container.
For instance:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.devservices.resource-aliases.policies=/policies.jar <1>
quarkus.keycloak.devservices.resource-mappings.policies=/opt/keycloak/providers/policies.jar <2>
----
<1> `policies` alias is created for the `/policies.jar` classpath resource.
Policy archive can also be located in the file system.
<2> The policies archive is mapped to the `/opt/keycloak/providers/policies.jar` container location.

== Running the application in JVM mode

After exploring the application in dev mode, you can run it as a standard Java application.

First compile it:

include::{includes}/devtools/build.adoc[]

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

== Running the application in native mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code; no modifications are required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your production environment because the runtime technology is included in the produced binary and optimized to run with minimal resources.

Compilation takes a bit longer, so this step is turned off by default; let's build again by enabling the `native` profile:

include::{includes}/devtools/build-native.adoc[]

After a while, you can run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart-runner
----

[[testing]]
== Testing the application

See the preceding <<keycloak-dev-mode,Running the application in Dev mode>> section about testing your application in a dev mode.

You can test the application launched in JVM or native modes with `curl`.

The application uses bearer token authorization, and the first thing to do is obtain an access token from the Keycloak server to access the application resources:

[source,bash]
----
export access_token=$(\
    curl --insecure -X POST https://localhost:8543/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=alice&password=alice&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 )
----

The preceding example obtains an access token for user `alice`.

Any user is allowed to access the
`http://localhost:8080/api/users/me` endpoint,
which returns a JSON payload with details about the user.

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/api/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer "$access_token
----

The `http://localhost:8080/api/admin` endpoint can only be accessed by users with the `admin` role.
If you try to access this endpoint with the previously issued access token, you get a `403` response from the server.

[source,bash]
----
 curl -v -X GET \
   http://localhost:8080/api/admin \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer "$access_token
----

To access the admin endpoint, get a token for the `admin` user:

[source,bash]
----
export access_token=$(\
    curl --insecure -X POST https://localhost:8543/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=admin&password=admin&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 )
----

== Injecting the authorization client

In some cases, using the link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/#_service_client_api[Keycloak Authorization Client Java API] is beneficial for tasks such as managing resources and obtaining permissions directly from Keycloak.
For this purpose, you can inject an `AuthzClient` instance into your beans as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class ProtectedResource {
    @Inject
    AuthzClient authzClient;
}
----

NOTE: If you want to use the `AuthzClient` directly, set `quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.enable=true`; otherwise, no bean is available for injection.

== Mapping protected resources

By default, the extension fetches resources on-demand from Keycloak, using their URI to identify and map the resources in your application that need to be protected.

To disable this on-demand fetching and instead pre-load resources at startup, apply the following configuration setting:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.lazy-load-paths=false
----

The time required to pre-load resources from Keycloak at startup varies based on their quantity, potentially affecting your application's initial load time."

== More about configuring protected resources

In the default configuration, Keycloak manages the roles and decides who can access which routes.

To configure the protected routes by using the `@RolesAllowed` annotation or the `application.properties` file, check the xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc[OpenID Connect (OIDC) Bearer token authentication] and xref:security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference.adoc[Authorization of web endpoints] guides.
For more details, check the xref:security-overview.adoc[Quarkus Security overview].

== Access to public resources

To enable access to a public resource without the `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` applying its policies, create a `permit` HTTP Policy configuration in `application.properties`.
For more information, see the xref:security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference.adoc[Authorization of web endpoints] guide.

There's no need to deactivate policy checks for a Keycloak Authorization Policy with settings such as these:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/public
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.enforcement-mode=DISABLED
----

To block access to the public resource to anonymous users, you can create an enforcing Keycloak Authorization Policy:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/public-enforcing
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.enforcement-mode=ENFORCING
----

Only the default tenant configuration applies when controlling anonymous access to the public resource is required.

== Checking permission scopes programmatically

In addition to resource permissions, you can specify method scopes.
The scope usually represents an action that can be performed on a resource.
You can create an enforcing Keycloak Authorization Policy with a method scope.
For example:

[source,properties]
----
# path policy with enforced scope 'read' for method 'GET'
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.name=Scope Permission Resource
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/protected/standard-way
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.methods.get.method=GET
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.methods.get.scopes=read <1>

# path policies without scope
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.2.name=Scope Permission Resource
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.2.path=/api/protected/programmatic-way
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.3.name=Scope Permission Resource
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.3.path=/api/protected/annotation-way
----
<1> User must have resource permission 'Scope Permission Resource' and scope 'read'

The Keycloak Policy Enforcer now secures the `/api/protected/standard-way` request path, eliminating the need for additional annotations such as `@RolesAllowed`.
However, in certain scenarios, a programmatic check is necessary.
You can achieve this by injecting a `SecurityIdentity` instance into your beans, as shown in the following example.
Or, you can get the same result by annotating the resource method with `@PermissionsAllowed`.
The following example demonstrates three resource methods, each requiring the same `read` scope:

[source,java]
----
import java.security.BasicPermission;
import java.util.List;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.ForbiddenException;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

import org.keycloak.representations.idm.authorization.Permission;

import io.quarkus.security.PermissionsAllowed;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

@Path("/api/protected")
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity identity;

    @GET
    @Path("/standard-way")
    public Uni<List<Permission>> standardWay() { <1>
        return Uni.createFrom().item(identity.<List<Permission>> getAttribute("permissions"));
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/programmatic-way")
    public Uni<List<Permission>> programmaticWay() {
        var requiredPermission = new BasicPermission("Scope Permission Resource") {
            @Override
            public String getActions() {
                return "read";
            }
        };
        return identity.checkPermission(requiredPermission).onItem() <2>
                .transform(granted -> {
                    if (granted) {
                        return identity.getAttribute("permissions");
                    }
                    throw new ForbiddenException();
                });
    }

    @PermissionsAllowed("Scope Permission Resource:read") <3>
    @GET
    @Path("/annotation-way")
    public Uni<List<Permission>> annotationWay() {
        return Uni.createFrom().item(identity.<List<Permission>> getAttribute("permissions"));
    }
}
----
<1> Request sub-path `/standard-way` requires both resource permission and scope `read` according to the configuration properties we previously set in the `application.properties`.
<2> Request sub-path `/programmatic-way` only requires permission `Scope Permission Resource`, but we can enforce scope with `SecurityIdentity#checkPermission`.
<3> The `@PermissionsAllowed` annotation only grants access to the requests with permission `Scope Permission Resource` and scope `read`.
For more information, see the section xref:security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference.adoc#standard-security-annotations[Authorization using annotations] of the Security Authorization guide.

== Multi-tenancy

You can set up policy enforcer configurations for each tenant, similar to how it is done with xref:security-openid-connect-multitenancy.adoc[OpenID Connect (OIDC) multi-tenancy].

For example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.enable=true

# Default Tenant
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret

quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.enforcement-mode=PERMISSIVE
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.name=Permission Resource
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/permission
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.claim-information-point.claims.static-claim=static-claim

# Service Tenant

quarkus.oidc.service-tenant.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.service-tenant.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.service-tenant.credentials.secret=secret

quarkus.keycloak.service-tenant.policy-enforcer.enforcement-mode=PERMISSIVE
quarkus.keycloak.service-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.name=Permission Resource Service
quarkus.keycloak.service-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/permission
quarkus.keycloak.service-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.claim-information-point.claims.static-claim=static-claim


# WebApp Tenant

quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.application-type=web-app
quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.roles.source=accesstoken

quarkus.keycloak.webapp-tenant.policy-enforcer.enforcement-mode=PERMISSIVE
quarkus.keycloak.webapp-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.name=Permission Resource WebApp
quarkus.keycloak.webapp-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/permission
quarkus.keycloak.webapp-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.claim-information-point.claims.static-claim=static-claim
----
