This guide explains how your Quarkus application can utilize https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] (OTel) to provide
Observability for interactive web applications.

On these page we show the signal independent features of the extension.

[NOTE]
====
- The old OpenTelemetry guide has been split into this generic guide, the xref:opentelemetry-tracing.adoc[OpenTelemetry Tracing Guide] and the new  xref:opentelemetry-metrics.adoc[OpenTelemetry Metrics Guide] has been created.
- OpenTelemetry Logging is not yet supported.
- The use of *the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/[OpenTelemetry Agent] is not needed nor recommended*. Quarkus Extensions and the libraries they provide, are directly instrumented. That agent doesn't work with native mode.
====

== Introduction
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry] is an Observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. Crucially, OpenTelemetry is vendor- and tool-agnostic.

Quarkus provides manual and automatic instrumentation for tracing and manual instrumentation  capabilities for metrics.

This will allow Quarkus based applications to be observable by tools and services supporting OpenTelemetry.

[NOTE]
====
Automatic metrics instrumentation in Quarkus is done by the xref:telemetry-micrometer.adoc[Quarkus Micrometer extension]. We plan to provide, in the future, a bridge for those metrics to be available in OpenTelemetry as well.
====

Quarkus supports the OpenTelemetry Autoconfiguration. The configurations match what you can see at
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/configuration/[OpenTelemetry SDK Autoconfigure]
with the `quarkus.*` prefix.

This guide provides a crosscutting explanation of the OpenTelemetry extension and how to use it. If you need details about any particular signal (tracing or metrics), please refer to the signal specific guide.

With the introduction of OpenTelemetry Metrics, the original, single page guide had to be split according to signal types, as follows:

=== xref:opentelemetry-tracing.adoc[OpenTelemetry Tracing Guide]

The tracing functionality is supported and *on* by default.

=== xref:opentelemetry-metrics.adoc[OpenTelemetry Metrics Guide]

==== Enable Metrics
The metrics functionality is experimental and *off* by default. You will need to activate it by setting:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.otel.metrics.enabled=true
----
At build time on your `application.properties` file.

==== Manual instrumentation only
For now only manual instrumentation is supported. You can use the OpenTelemetry API to create and record metrics but Quarkus is not yet providing automatic instrumentation for metrics.

In the future, we plan to bridge current Micrometer metrics to OpenTelemetry and maintain compatibility when possible.

== Using the extension

If you already have your Quarkus project, you can add the `quarkus-opentelemetry` extension
to it by running the following command in your project base directory:

:add-extension-extensions: opentelemetry
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

This will add the following to your build file:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-opentelemetry</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-opentelemetry")
----


=== Create the configuration

:opentelemetry-config:
include::{includes}/opentelemetry-config.adoc[]

=== Disable all or parts of the OpenTelemetry extension

Once you add the dependency, the extension will generate tracing data by default. To enable metrics or disable the OpenTelemetry extension globally or partially these are the properties to use (they are extracted from the config reference bellow):

|===
|Affected Signal | Property name |Default value |Description

| All
|`quarkus.otel.enabled`
|true
|If false, disable the OpenTelemetry usage at *build* time.

| All
|`quarkus.otel.sdk.disabled`
|false
|Comes from the OpenTelemetry autoconfiguration. If true, will disable the OpenTelemetry SDK usage at *runtime*.

| All output
|`quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.enabled`
|true
|Deprecated for removal.

If false will disable the default OTLP exporter at *build* time.

| Traces
|`quarkus.otel.traces.enabled`
|true
|If false, disable the OpenTelemetry tracing usage at *build* time.

| Traces output
|`quarkus.otel.traces.exporter`
|cdi
|List of exporters to be used for tracing, separated by commas. Has one of the values from _ExporterType_: `otlp`, `cdi`, `none`. This is a *build* time property and setting it to `none` will disable tracing data output.

| Metrics
|`quarkus.otel.metrics.enabled`
|false
|Metrics are disabled by default at *build* time because they are experimental.

| Metrics output
|`quarkus.otel.metrics.exporter`
|cdi
|List of exporters to be used for metrics, separated by commas. Has one of the values from _ExporterType_: `otlp`, `cdi`, `none`. This is a *build* time property and setting it to `none` will disable metrics data output.
|===

If you need to enable or disable the exporter at runtime, you can use the xref:opentelemetry-tracing.adoc#sampler[sampler] because it has the ability to filter out all the spans if needed.

Particular instrumentation components can be disabled in tracing, like ignore client requests but keep server ones. For more details, please check the xref:opentelemetry-tracing.adoc[OpenTelemetry Tracing Guide].

=== Resource
A https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/overview.md#resources[resource] is a representation
of the entity that is producing telemetry, it adds attributes to the exported trace or metric to characterize who is producing the telemetry. Quarkus follows the https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/configuration/#resources[resources auto-configuration] specified by the Java OpenTelemetry SDK.

==== Default
The following attributes are added by default to resources.

|===
|Attribute name|Content example|Origin

|service.name
|"opentelemetry-quickstart"
|Value comes from the artifactId, from the `quarkus.application.name` property or from `quarkus.otel.resource.attributes=service.name=cart` property.

|host.name
|"myHost"
|Resolved at startup

|service.version
|"1.0-SNAPSHOT"
|Resolved at build time from the artifact version

|telemetry.sdk.language
|"java"
|Static value

|telemetry.sdk.name
|"opentelemetry"
|Resolved at build time

|telemetry.sdk.version
|"1.32.0"
|Resolved at build time

|webengine.name
|"Quarkus"
|Static value

|webengine.version
|"999-SNAPSHOT"
|Quarkus version resolved at build time
|===

==== Using configuration
You can add additional attributes by setting the `quarkus.otel.resource.attributes` config property that is described in the <<configuration-reference>>.
Since this property can be overridden at runtime, the OpenTelemetry extension will pick up its value following the order of precedence that
is described in the xref:config-reference.adoc#configuration-sources[Quarkus Configuration Reference].

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.otel.resource.attributes=deployment.environment=dev,service.name=cart,service.namespace=shopping
----

This will add the attributes for `deployment.environment`, `service.name` and `service.namespace` to the resource and be included in traces and metrics.

==== Using CDI beans
If by any means you need to use a custom resource or one that is provided by one of the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions[OpenTelemetry SDK Extensions]
you can create multiple resource producers. The OpenTelemetry extension will detect the `Resource` CDI beans and will merge them when configuring the OTel SDK.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomConfiguration {

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    public Resource osResource() {
        return OsResource.get();
    }

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    public Resource ecsResource() {
        return EcsResource.get();
    }
}
----

=== Semantic conventions

OpenTelemetry provides a set of https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/[semantic conventions] to standardize the data collected by the instrumentation.

When creating manual instrumentation, while naming metrics or attributes you should follow those conventions and not create new names to represent existing conventions. This will make data correlation easier to perform across services.

== Exporters

=== Default

The Quarkus OpenTelemetry extension uses its own signal exporters built on top of Vert.x for optimal performance and maintainability.

The exporter is automatically wired with CDI, that's why the `quarkus.otel.traces.exporter` and `quarkus.otel.metrics.exporter` properties default to `cdi`.

The `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.protocol` defaults to `grpc` but `http/protobuf` can also be used.

NOTE: If you change the protocol, you also need to change the port in the endpoint. The default port for `grpc` is `4317` and for `http/protobuf` is `4318`.

=== On Quarkiverse
Additional exporters will be available in the Quarkiverse https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-opentelemetry-exporter/dev/index.html[quarkus-opentelemetry-exporter] project.

Currently, are available the following exporters (may be outdated) for:

- Legacy Jaeger
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud

Also on Quarkiverse, the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-amazon-services/dev/opentelemetry.html[Quarkus AWS SDK has integration with OpenTelemetry].

=== Logging exporter (for debugging)

You can output all metrics to the console, for debugging/development purposes.

IMPORTANT: Don't use this in production.

You will need to add the following dependency to your project:
[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>
    <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-logging</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-exporter-logging")
----


Then, setting the exporter to `logging` in the `application.properties` file:
[source, properties]
----
quarkus.otel.metrics.exporter=logging <1>
quarkus.otel.metric.export.interval=10000ms <2>
quarkus.otel.traces.exporter=logging <3>
----

<1> Set the metrics exporter to `logging`. Normally you don't need to set this. The default is `cdi`.
<2> Set the interval to export the metrics. The default is `1m`, which is too long for debugging.
<3> Set the traces exporter to `logging`. Normally you don't need to set this. The default is `cdi`.

== Visualizing the data

We recommend the xref:observability-devservices-lgtm.adoc[Getting Started with Grafana-OTel-LGTM].

This provides a Quarkus Dev service using an "all-in-one" https://github.com/grafana/docker-otel-lgtm[Grafana OTel LGTM].

Grafana is used to visualize data, Loki to store logs, Tempo to store traces and Prometheus to store metrics. Also provides and OTel collector to receive the data.

This provides an easy way to visualize all OpenTelemetry data generated by the application.

You can also use the xref:logging-exporter-for-debugging[logging exporter] to output all traces and metrics to the console.

[[configuration-reference]]
== OpenTelemetry Configuration Reference

Quarkus supports the OpenTelemetry Autoconfiguration for Traces.
The configurations match what you can see at
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md[OpenTelemetry SDK Autoconfigure]
adding the usual `quarkus.*` prefix.

Quarkus OpenTelemetry configuration properties now have the `quarkus.otel.*` prefix.
