= Enable HTTP Basic authentication
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Enable the HTTP Basic authentication for your Quarkus project and allow users to authenticate with a username and password.
 
== Prerequisites
 
* You have installed at least one extension that provides an `IdentityProvider` based on username and password, such as xref:security-jdbc.adoc[Elytron JDBC].
 
. Enable Basic authentication by setting the value of `quarkus.http.auth.basic` property to `true`.
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.basic=true
----
 
For a Basic authentication configuration walk-through that uses `JPA`, see the xref:security-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started With Security] guide.
