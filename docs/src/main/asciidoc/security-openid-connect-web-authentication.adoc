= Quarkus - Using OpenID Connect to Protect Web Applications using Authorization Code Flow.

include::./attributes.adoc[]
:toc:

This guide demonstrates how to use Quarkus OpenID Connect Extension to protect your Quarkus HTTP endpoints using OpenId Connect Authorization Code Flow supported by OpenId Connect compliant Authorization Servers such as https://www.keycloak.org/about.html[Keycloak].

The extension allows to easily authenticate the users of your web application by redirecting them to the OpenID Connect Provider (e.g.: Keycloak) to login and, once the authentication is complete, return them back with the code confirming the successful authentication. The extension will request ID and access tokens from the OpenID Connect Provider using an authorization code grant and verify these tokens in order to authorize an access to the application.

Please read the link:security-openid-connect[Using OpenID Connect to Protect Service Applications] guide if you need to protect your applications using Bearer Token Authorization.

Please read the link:security-openid-connect-multitenancy[Using OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy] guide how to support multiple tenants.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq tool]
* Docker

== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple web application with a single page:

* `/index.html`

This page is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart \
    -Dextensions="oidc"
cd security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart
----

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `oidc` extension
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="oidc"
----

This will add the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Configuring the application

The OpenID Connect extension allows you to define the configuration using the `application.properties` file which should be located at the `src/main/resources` directory.

=== Configuring using the application.properties file

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated
----

This is the simplest configuration you can have when enabling authentication to your application. 

The `quarkus.oidc.client-id` property references the `client_id` issued by the OpenID Connect Provider and, in this case, the application is a public client (no client secret is defined).

The `quarkus.oidc.application-type` property is set to `web-app` in order to tell Quarkus that you want to enable the OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow, so that your users are redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to authenticate.

For last, the `quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated` permission is set to tell Quarkus about the paths you want to protect. In this case,
all paths are being protected by a policy that ensures that only `authenticated` users are allowed to access. For more details check link:security[Security Guide].

=== Configuring CORS

If you plan to consume this application from another application running on a different domain, you will need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Please read the link:http-reference#cors-filter[HTTP CORS documentation] for more details.

== Starting and Configuring the Keycloak Server

To start a Keycloak Server you can use Docker and just run the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 8180:8080 {keycloak-docker-image}
----

You should be able to access your Keycloak Server at http://localhost:8180/auth[localhost:8180/auth].

Log in as the `admin` user to access the Keycloak Administration Console. Username should be `admin` and password `admin`.

Import the {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] to create a new realm. For more details, see the Keycloak documentation about how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_create-realm[create a new realm].

== Running and Using the Application

=== Running in Developer Mode

To run the microservice in dev mode, use `./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev`.

=== Running in JVM Mode

When you're done playing with "dev-mode" you can run it as a standard Java application.

First compile it:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package
----

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar ./target/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart-runner.jar
----

=== Running in Native Mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code: no modifications required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your
production environment, as the runtime technology is included in
the produced binary, and optimized to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compilation will take a bit longer, so this step is disabled by default;
let's build again by enabling the `native` profile:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative
----

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart-runner
----

== Testing the Application

To test the application, you should open your browser and access the following URL:

* http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080]

If everything is working as expected, you should be redirected to the Keycloak server to authenticate.

In order to authenticate to the application you should type the following credentials when at the Keycloak login page:

* Username: *alice*
* Password: *alice*

After clicking the `Login` button you should be redirected back to the application.

== Redirection

When the user is redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to authenticate, the redirect URL includes a `redirect_uri` query parameter which indicates to the Provider where the user has to be redirected to once the authentication has been completed.

Quarkus will set this parameter to the current request URL by default. For example, if the user is trying to access a Quarkus service endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/service/1` then the `redirect_uri` parameter will be set to `http://localhost:8080/service/1`. Similarly, if the request URL is `http://localhost:8080/service/2` then the `redirect_uri` parameter will be set to `http://localhost:8080/service/2`, etc.

OpenID Connect Providers may be configured to require the `redirect_uri` parameter to have the same value (eg. `http://localhost:8080/service/callback`) for all the redirect URLs.
In such cases a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path` property has to be set, for example, `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/service/callback`, and Quarkus will set the `redirect_uri` parameter to an absolute URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/callback` which will be the same regardless of the current request URL.

If `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path` is set but the original request URL has to be restored after the user has been redirected back to a callback URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/callback` then a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect` property has to be set to `true` which will restore the request URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/1`, etc.

== Logout

By default the logout is based on the expiration time of the ID Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider. When the ID Token expires, the current user session at the Quarkus endpoint is invalidated and the user is redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider again to authenticate. If the session at the OpenID Connect Provider is still active, users are automatically re-authenticated without having to provide their credentials again.

The current user session may be automatically extended by enabling a `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-expired` property. If it is set to `true` then when the current ID Token expires a Refresh Token Grant will be used to refresh ID Token as well as Access and Refresh Tokens.

=== User-Initiated Logout

Users can request a logout by sending a request to the Quarkus endpoint logout path set with a `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` property.
For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` is set to "/logout" then the logout request has to be sent to `https://application.com/webapp/logout`.

This logout request will start an https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-Initiated Logout] and the user will be redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to logout where a user may be asked to confirm the logout is indeed intended.

The user will be returned to the endpoint post logout page once the logout has been completed if the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` property is set. For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set to "/signin" then the user will be returned to `https://application.com/webapp/signin` (note this URI must be registered as a valid `post_logout_redirect_uri` in the OpenID Connect Provider).

If the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set then a `q_post_logout` cookie will be created and a matching `state` query parameter will be added to the logout redirect URI and the OpenID Connect Provider will return this `state` once the logout has been completed. It is recommended for the Quarkus `web-app` applications to check that a `state` query parameter matches the value of the `q_post_logout` cookie which can be done for example in a JAX-RS filter.

Note that a cookie name will vary when using link:security-openid-connect-multitenancy[OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy]. For example, it will be named `q_post_logout_tenant_1` for a tenant with a `tenant_1` id, etc.

== Accessing ID and Access Tokens

ID Token is always a JWT token. One can access ID Token claims by injecting `JsonWebToken` with an `IdToken` qualifier:

[source, java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.IdToken;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    @IdToken
    JsonWebToken idToken;

    @GET
    public String getUserName() {
        return idToken.getName();
    }
}
----

Access Token is usually used by the OIDC `web-app` application to access other endpoints on behalf of the currently logged in user. The raw access token can be accessed as follows:

[source, java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.AccessTokenCredential;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    JsonWebToken accessToken;

    // or
    // @Inject
    // AccessTokenCredential accessTokenCredential;

    @GET
    public String getReservationOnBehalfOfUser() {
        String rawAccessToken = accessToken.getRawToken();
        //or
        //String rawAccessToken = accessTokenCredential.getToken();

        // Use the raw access token to access a remote endpoint
        return getReservationfromRemoteEndpoint(rawAccesstoken);
    }
}
----

Note that `AccessTokenCredential` will have to be used if the Access Token issued to the Quarkus `web-app` application is opaque (binary) and can not be parsed to `JsonWebToken`.

Injection of the `JsonWebToken` and `AccessTokenCredential` is supported in both `@RequestScoped` and `@ApplicationScoped` contexts.

== User Info

Set `quarkus.oidc.user-info-required=true` if a UserInfo JSON object from the OIDC userinfo endpoint has to be requested.
This will make an `io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo` (which is a simple `javax.json.JsonObject` wrapper) object accessible as a SecurityIdentity `userinfo` attribute.

== Token Claims And SecurityIdentity Roles

The way the roles are mapped to the SecurityIdentity roles from the verified tokens is identical to how it is done for the link:security-openid-connect#token-claims-and-securityidentity-roles[bearer tokens] with the only difference being is that https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[ID Token] is used as a source of the roles by default.

Note if you use Keycloak then you should set a Microprofile JWT client scope for ID token to contain a `groups` claim, please see the https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#protocol[Keycloak Server Administration Guide] for more information.

If only the access token contains the roles and this access token is not meant to be propagated to the downstream endpoints then set `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`.

If UserInfo is the source of the roles then set `quarkus.oidc.user-info-required=true` and `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=userinfo`, and if needed, `quarkus.oidc.roles.role-claim-path`.

== Single Page Applications

Please check if implementing SPAs the way it is suggested in the link:security-openid-connect#single-page-applications[Single Page Applications for Service Applications] section can meet your requirements.

If you prefer to use SPA and `XMLHttpRequest`(XHR) with Quarkus web applications, please be aware that OpenID Connect Providers may not support CORS for Authorization endpoints where the users are authenticated after a redirect from Quarkus. This will lead to authentication failures if the Quarkus application and the OpenID Connect Provider are hosted on the different HTTP domains/ports.

In such cases, set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.xhr-auto-redirect` property to `false` which will instruct Quarkus to return a `499` status code and `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `OIDC` value. The browser script also needs to be updated to set `X-Requested-With` header with the `XMLHttpRequest` value and reload the last requested page in case of `499`, for example:

[source,javascript]
----
Future<void> callQuarkusService() async {
    Map<String, String> headers = Map.fromEntries([MapEntry("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest")]);

    await http
        .get("https://localhost:443/serviceCall")
        .then((response) {
            if (response.statusCode == 499) {
                window.location.assign("https://localhost.com:443/serviceCall");
            }
         });
  }
----

== Running behind a reverse proxy

OIDC authentication mechanism can be affected if your Quarkus application is running behind a reverse proxy/gateway/firewall when HTTP `Host` header may be reset to the internal IP address, HTTPS connection may be terminated, etc. For example, an authorization code flow `redirect_uri` parameter may be set to the internal host instead of the expected external one.

In such cases configuring Quarkus to recognize the original headers forwarded by the proxy will be required, see link:vertx#reverse-proxy[Running behind a reverse proxy] Vert.x documentation section for more information.

`quarkus.oidc.authentication.force-redirect-https-scheme` property may also be used when the Quarkus application is running behind a SSL terminating reverse proxy.
