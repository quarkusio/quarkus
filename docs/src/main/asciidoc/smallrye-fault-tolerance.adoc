= SmallRye Fault Tolerance
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: web, observability
:summary: This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can utilize the SmallRye Fault Tolerance specification through the SmallRye Fault Tolerance extension.
:topics: fault-tolerance,resiliency
:extensions: io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-fault-tolerance

One of the challenges brought by the distributed nature of microservices is that communication with external systems is
inherently unreliable. This increases demand on resiliency of applications. To simplify making more resilient
applications, Quarkus provides https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/[SmallRye Fault Tolerance], an
implementation of the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/[MicroProfile Fault Tolerance]
specification.

In this guide, we demonstrate usage of MicroProfile Fault Tolerance annotations such as `@Timeout`, `@Fallback`,
`@Retry`, `@CircuitBreaker`, and `@RateLimit`.

== Prerequisites

include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]

== The Scenario

The application built in this guide simulates a simple backend for a gourmet coffee e-shop. It implements a REST
endpoint providing information about coffee samples we have on store.

Let's imagine, although it's not implemented as such, that some methods in our endpoint require communication
to external services like a database or an external microservice, which introduces a factor of unreliability.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `microprofile-fault-tolerance-quickstart` link:{quickstarts-tree-url}/microprofile-fault-tolerance-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

:create-app-artifact-id: microprofile-fault-tolerance-quickstart
:create-app-extensions: smallrye-fault-tolerance,rest-jackson
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

This command generates a project, importing the extensions for Quarkus REST (formerly RESTEasy Reactive)/Jakarta REST and SmallRye Fault Tolerance.

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `smallrye-fault-tolerance` extension
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

:add-extension-extensions: smallrye-fault-tolerance
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

This will add the following to your build file:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-fault-tolerance</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-fault-tolerance")
----

== Preparing an Application: REST Endpoint and CDI Bean

In this section we create a skeleton of our application, so that we have something that we can extend and to which
we can add fault tolerance features later on.

First, create a simple entity representing a coffee sample in our store:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.microprofile.faulttolerance;

public class Coffee {

    public Integer id;
    public String name;
    public String countryOfOrigin;
    public Integer price;

    public Coffee() {
    }

    public Coffee(Integer id, String name, String countryOfOrigin, Integer price) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.countryOfOrigin = countryOfOrigin;
        this.price = price;
    }
}
----

Let's continue with a simple CDI bean, that would work as a repository of our coffee samples.

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.microprofile.faulttolerance;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class CoffeeRepositoryService {

    private Map<Integer, Coffee> coffeeList = new HashMap<>();

    public CoffeeRepositoryService() {
        coffeeList.put(1, new Coffee(1, "Fernandez Espresso", "Colombia", 23));
        coffeeList.put(2, new Coffee(2, "La Scala Whole Beans", "Bolivia", 18));
        coffeeList.put(3, new Coffee(3, "Dak Lak Filter", "Vietnam", 25));
    }

    public List<Coffee> getAllCoffees() {
        return new ArrayList<>(coffeeList.values());
    }

    public Coffee getCoffeeById(Integer id) {
        return coffeeList.get(id);
    }

    public List<Coffee> getRecommendations(Integer id) {
        if (id == null) {
            return Collections.emptyList();
        }
        return coffeeList.values().stream()
                .filter(coffee -> !id.equals(coffee.id))
                .limit(2)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
----

Finally, create the `org.acme.microprofile.faulttolerance.CoffeeResource` class as follows:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.microprofile.faulttolerance;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

import org.jboss.logging.Logger;

@Path("/coffee")
public class CoffeeResource {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(CoffeeResource.class);

    @Inject
    CoffeeRepositoryService coffeeRepository;

    private AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong(0);

    @GET
    public List<Coffee> coffees() {
        final Long invocationNumber = counter.getAndIncrement();

        maybeFail(String.format("CoffeeResource#coffees() invocation #%d failed", invocationNumber));

        LOGGER.infof("CoffeeResource#coffees() invocation #%d returning successfully", invocationNumber);
        return coffeeRepository.getAllCoffees();
    }

    private void maybeFail(String failureLogMessage) {
        if (new Random().nextBoolean()) {
            LOGGER.error(failureLogMessage);
            throw new RuntimeException("Resource failure.");
        }
    }
}
----

At this point, we expose a single REST method that will show a list of coffee samples in a JSON format. Note
that we introduced some fault making code in our `CoffeeResource#maybeFail()` method, which is going to cause failures
in the `CoffeeResource#coffees()` endpoint method in about 50 % of requests.

Why not check that our application works? Run the Quarkus development server with:

include::{includes}/devtools/dev.adoc[]

and open `http://localhost:8080/coffee` in your browser. Make a couple of requests (remember, some of them are expected
to fail). At least some requests should show us the list of our coffee samples in JSON, the rest will fail
with a `RuntimeException` thrown in `CoffeeResource#maybeFail()`.

Congratulations, you've just made a working (although somewhat unreliable) Quarkus application!

== Adding Resiliency: Retries

Let the Quarkus development server running and in your IDE add the `@Retry` annotation to the `CoffeeResource#coffees()`
method as follows and save the file:

[source,java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Retry;
...

public class CoffeeResource {
    ...
    @GET
    @Retry(maxRetries = 4)
    public List<Coffee> coffees() {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----

Hit refresh in your browser. The Quarkus development server will automatically detect the changes
and recompile the app for you, so there's no need to restart it.

You can hit refresh couple more times. Practically all requests should now be succeeding. The `CoffeeResource#coffees()`
method is still in fact failing in about 50 % of time, but every time it happens, the platform will automatically retry
the call!

To see that the failures still happen, check the output of the development server. The log messages should be
similar to these:

[source]
----
2019-03-06 12:17:41,725 INFO  [org.acm.fau.CoffeeResource] (XNIO-1 task-1) CoffeeResource#coffees() invocation #5 returning successfully
2019-03-06 12:17:44,187 INFO  [org.acm.fau.CoffeeResource] (XNIO-1 task-1) CoffeeResource#coffees() invocation #6 returning successfully
2019-03-06 12:17:45,166 ERROR [org.acm.fau.CoffeeResource] (XNIO-1 task-1) CoffeeResource#coffees() invocation #7 failed
2019-03-06 12:17:45,172 ERROR [org.acm.fau.CoffeeResource] (XNIO-1 task-1) CoffeeResource#coffees() invocation #8 failed
2019-03-06 12:17:45,176 INFO  [org.acm.fau.CoffeeResource] (XNIO-1 task-1) CoffeeResource#coffees() invocation #9 returning successfully
----

You can see that every time an invocation fails, it's immediately followed by another invocation, until one succeeds.
Since we allowed 4 retries, it would require 5 invocations to fail in a row, in order for the user to be actually exposed
to a failure. Which is fairly unlikely to happen.

== Adding Resiliency: Timeouts

So what else have we got in MicroProfile Fault Tolerance? Let's look into timeouts.

Add following two methods to our `CoffeeResource` endpoint. Again, no need to restart the server, just paste the code
and save the file.

[source,java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Timeout;
...
public class CoffeeResource {
    ...
    @GET
    @Path("/{id}/recommendations")
    @Timeout(250)
    public List<Coffee> recommendations(int id) {
        long started = System.currentTimeMillis();
        final long invocationNumber = counter.getAndIncrement();

        try {
            randomDelay();
            LOGGER.infof("CoffeeResource#recommendations() invocation #%d returning successfully", invocationNumber);
            return coffeeRepository.getRecommendations(id);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            LOGGER.errorf("CoffeeResource#recommendations() invocation #%d timed out after %d ms",
                    invocationNumber, System.currentTimeMillis() - started);
            return null;
        }
    }

    private void randomDelay() throws InterruptedException {
        Thread.sleep(new Random().nextInt(500));
    }
}
----

We added some new functionality. We want to be able to recommend some related coffees based on a coffee that a user
is currently looking at. It's not a critical functionality, it's a nice-to-have. When the system is overloaded and the
logic behind obtaining recommendations takes too long to execute, we would rather time out and render the UI without
recommendations.

Note that the timeout was configured to 250 ms, and a random artificial delay between 0 and 500 ms was introduced
into the `CoffeeResource#recommendations()` method.

In your browser, go to `http://localhost:8080/coffee/2/recommendations` and hit refresh a couple of times.

You should see some requests time out with `org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.exceptions.TimeoutException`.
Requests that do not time out should show two recommended coffee samples in JSON.

== Adding Resiliency: Fallbacks

Let's make our recommendations feature even better by providing a fallback (and presumably faster) way of getting related
coffees.

Add a fallback method to `CoffeeResource` and a `@Fallback` annotation to `CoffeeResource#recommendations()` method
as follows:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.Collections;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Fallback;

...
public class CoffeeResource {
    ...
    @Fallback(fallbackMethod = "fallbackRecommendations")
    public List<Coffee> recommendations(int id) {
        ...
    }

    public List<Coffee> fallbackRecommendations(int id) {
        LOGGER.info("Falling back to RecommendationResource#fallbackRecommendations()");
        // safe bet, return something that everybody likes
        return Collections.singletonList(coffeeRepository.getCoffeeById(1));
    }
    ...
}
----

Hit refresh several times on `http://localhost:8080/coffee/2/recommendations`.
The `TimeoutException` should not appear anymore. Instead, in case of a timeout, the page will
display a single recommendation that we hardcoded in our fallback method `fallbackRecommendations()`, rather than
two recommendations returned by the original method.

Check the server output to see that fallback is really happening:

[source]
----
2020-01-09 13:21:34,250 INFO  [org.acm.fau.CoffeeResource] (executor-thread-1) CoffeeResource#recommendations() invocation #1 returning successfully
2020-01-09 13:21:36,354 ERROR [org.acm.fau.CoffeeResource] (executor-thread-1) CoffeeResource#recommendations() invocation #2 timed out after 250 ms
2020-01-09 13:21:36,355 INFO  [org.acm.fau.CoffeeResource] (executor-thread-1) Falling back to RecommendationResource#fallbackRecommendations()
----

NOTE: The fallback method is required to have the same parameters as the original method.

== Adding Resiliency: Circuit Breaker

A circuit breaker is useful for limiting number of failures happening in the system, when part of the system becomes
temporarily unstable. The circuit breaker records successful and failed invocations of a method, and when the ratio
of failed invocations reaches the specified threshold, the circuit breaker _opens_ and blocks all further invocations
of that method for a given time.

Add the following code into the `CoffeeRepositoryService` bean, so that we can demonstrate a circuit breaker in action:

[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.CircuitBreaker;
...

public class CoffeeRepositoryService {
    ...

    private AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong(0);

    @CircuitBreaker(requestVolumeThreshold = 4)
    public Integer getAvailability(Coffee coffee) {
        maybeFail();
        return new Random().nextInt(30);
    }

    private void maybeFail() {
        // introduce some artificial failures
        final Long invocationNumber = counter.getAndIncrement();
        if (invocationNumber % 4 > 1) { // alternate 2 successful and 2 failing invocations
            throw new RuntimeException("Service failed.");
        }
    }
}
----

And inject the code below into the `CoffeeResource` endpoint:

[source,java]
----
public class CoffeeResource {
    ...
    @Path("/{id}/availability")
    @GET
    public Response availability(int id) {
        final Long invocationNumber = counter.getAndIncrement();

        Coffee coffee = coffeeRepository.getCoffeeById(id);
        // check that coffee with given id exists, return 404 if not
        if (coffee == null) {
            return Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
        }

        try {
            Integer availability = coffeeRepository.getAvailability(coffee);
            LOGGER.infof("CoffeeResource#availability() invocation #%d returning successfully", invocationNumber);
            return Response.ok(availability).build();
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            String message = e.getClass().getSimpleName() + ": " + e.getMessage();
            LOGGER.errorf("CoffeeResource#availability() invocation #%d failed: %s", invocationNumber, message);
            return Response.status(Response.Status.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                    .entity(message)
                    .type(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN_TYPE)
                    .build();
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

We added another functionality - the application can return the amount of remaining packages of given coffee on our store
(just a random number).

This time an artificial failure was introduced in the CDI bean: the `CoffeeRepositoryService#getAvailability()` method is
going to alternate between two successful and two failed invocations.

We also added a `@CircuitBreaker` annotation with `requestVolumeThreshold = 4`. `CircuitBreaker.failureRatio` is
by default 0.5, and `CircuitBreaker.delay` is by default 5 seconds. That means that a circuit breaker will open
when 2 of the last 4 invocations failed, and it will stay open for 5 seconds.

To test this out, do the following:

1. Go to `http://localhost:8080/coffee/2/availability` in your browser. You should see a number being returned.
2. Hit refresh, this second request should again be successful and return a number.
3. Refresh two more times. Both times you should see text "RuntimeException: Service failed.", which is the exception
   thrown by `CoffeeRepositoryService#getAvailability()`.
4. Refresh a couple more times. Unless you waited too long, you should again see exception, but this time it's
   "CircuitBreakerOpenException: getAvailability". This exception indicates that the circuit breaker opened
   and the `CoffeeRepositoryService#getAvailability()` method is not being called anymore.
5. Give it 5 seconds during which circuit breaker should close, and you should be able to make two successful requests
   again.

== Adding Resiliency: Rate Limits

IMPORTANT: This is an additional feature of https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance/[SmallRye Fault Tolerance] and is not specified by MicroProfile Fault Tolerance.

It is possible to prevent an operation from being executed too often using a _rate limit_. Rate limits enforce a maximum number of permitted invocations in a time window of some length. For example, with a rate limit, one can make sure that a method may only be called 50 times per minute. Invocations that would exceed the limit are rejected with an exception of type `RateLimitException`.

Additionally, it is possible to define minimum spacing between invocations. For example, with a minimum spacing of 1 second, if a second invocation happens 500 millis after the first, it is rejected even if the limit would not be exceeded yet.

Rate limit is superficially similar to a bulkhead (concurrency limit), but is in fact quite different. Bulkhead limits the number of executions happening concurrently at any point in time. Rate limit limits the number of executions in a time window of some length, without considering concurrency.

Rate limits need to maintain some state between invocations: the number of recent invocations, the time stamp of last invocation, and so on. This state is a singleton, irrespective of the lifecycle of the bean that uses the `@RateLimit` annotation.

More specifically, the rate limit state is uniquely identified by the combination of the bean class (`java.lang.Class`) and the method object (`java.lang.reflect.Method`) representing the guarded method.

Let the Quarkus development mode run and in your IDE add the `@RateLimit` annotation to the `CoffeeResource#coffees()` method as follows and save the file:

[source,java]
----
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;
import io.smallrye.faulttolerance.api.RateLimit;

...
public class CoffeeResource {
    ...
    @GET
    @RateLimit(value = 2, window = 10, windowUnit = ChronoUnit.SECONDS)
    public List<Coffee> coffees() {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----

Hit refresh in your browser. The Quarkus development server will automatically detect the changes and recompile the app for you, so there’s no need to restart it.

You can hit refresh a couple more times. After 2 requests within a 10 second interval you should start seeing errors in the logs, similar to these:

[source]
----

----

If `@Fallback` is used with `@RateLimit`, the fallback method or handler may be invoked if a `RateLimitException` is thrown, depending on the fallback configuration.

If `@Retry` is used with `@RateLimit`, each retry attempt is processed by the rate limit as an independent invocation. If `RateLimitException` is thrown, the execution may be retried, depending on how the retry is configured.

If `@CircuitBreaker` is used with `@RateLimit`, the circuit breaker is checked before enforcing the rate limit. If rate limiting results in `RateLimitException`, this may be counted as a failure, depending on how the circuit breaker is configured.

== Runtime configuration

You can override the annotations parameters at runtime inside your `application.properties` file.

If we take the retry example that we already saw:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance.Retry;
...

public class CoffeeResource {
    ...
    @GET
    @Retry(maxRetries = 4)
    public List<Coffee> coffees() {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
----

We can override the `maxRetries` parameter with 6 retries instead of 4 by the following configuration item:
[source,properties]
----
org.acme.CoffeeResource/coffees/Retry/maxRetries=6
----

NOTE: The format is `fully-qualified-class-name/method-name/annotation-name/property-name=value`.
You can also configure a property for all the annotation via `annotation-name/property-name=value`.

== Conclusion

SmallRye Fault Tolerance allows to improve resiliency of your application, without having an impact on the complexity
of our business logic.

All that is needed to enable the fault tolerance features in Quarkus is:

:devtools-wrapped:
* adding the `smallrye-fault-tolerance` Quarkus extension to your project using the `quarkus-maven-plugin`:
+
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]
* or simply adding the following Maven dependency:

.pom.xml

== Additional resources

SmallRye Fault Tolerance has more features than shown here.
Please check the link:https://smallrye.io/docs/smallrye-fault-tolerance/6.3.0/index.html[SmallRye Fault Tolerance documentation] to learn about them.

In Quarkus, you can use the SmallRye Fault Tolerance optional features out of the box.

Support for Mutiny is present, so your asynchronous methods can return `Uni` in addition to `CompletionStage`.

MicroProfile Context Propagation is integrated with Fault Tolerance, so existing contexts are automatically propagated to your asynchronous methods.

[NOTE]
====
This also applies to the CDI request context: if it is active on the original thread, it is propagated to the new thread, but if it's not, then the new thread won't have it either.
This is contrary to MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification, which states that the request context must be active during the `@Asynchronous` method invocation.

We believe that in presence of MicroProfile Context Propagation, this requirement should not apply.
The entire point of context propagation is to make sure the new thread has the same contexts as the original thread.
====

Non-compatible mode is enabled by default.
This means that methods that return `CompletionStage` (or `Uni`) have asynchronous fault tolerance applied without any `@Asynchronous`, `@AsynchronousNonBlocking`, `@Blocking` or `@NonBlocking` annotation.
It also means that circuit breaker, fallback and retry automatically inspect the exception cause chain if the exception itself is insufficient to decide what should happen.

[NOTE]
====
This mode is not compatible with the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification, albeit the incompatibility is very small.
To restore full compatibility, add this configuration property:

[source,properties]
----
smallrye.faulttolerance.mp-compatibility=true
----
====

The link:https://smallrye.io/docs/smallrye-fault-tolerance/6.3.0/reference/programmatic-api.html[programmatic API] is present, including Mutiny support, and integrated with the declarative, annotation-based API.
You can use the `FaultTolerance` and `MutinyFaultTolerance` APIs out of the box.

Support for Kotlin is present (assuming you use the Quarkus extension for Kotlin), so you can guard your `suspend` functions with fault tolerance annotations.

Metrics are automatically discovered and integrated.
If your application uses the Quarkus extension for Micrometer, SmallRye Fault Tolerance will emit metrics to Micrometer.
If your application uses the Quarkus extension for SmallRye Metrics, SmallRye Fault Tolerance will emit metrics to MicroProfile Metrics.
Otherwise, SmallRye Fault Tolerance metrics will be disabled.
