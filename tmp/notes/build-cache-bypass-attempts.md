# Build Cache Bypass Attempts

## Problem
Develocity build cache prevents code changes from taking effect despite multiple compilation attempts.

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Environment Variables
- `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_BUILD_CACHE_ENABLED=false mvn clean compile`
- Result: Still loads from cache

### 2. System Properties  
- `mvn clean compile -Dgradle.enterprise.build-cache.enabled=false`
- Result: Still loads from cache

### 3. Source File Touching
- `find maven-plugin/src -name "*.kt" -exec touch {} \;`
- Result: Still loads from cache

### 4. Target Directory Removal
- `rm -rf maven-plugin/target && mvn compile`
- Result: Still loads from cache

### 5. Offline Mode
- `mvn compile -o`
- Result: Still loads from cache

## Current Status
The code changes are correct:
- Goal string construction now includes execution ID when present
- Target name generation uses 3-parameter method with execution ID
- All compilation attempts succeed without errors

However, the analysis output still shows old goal format:
- Current: `"org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-enforcer-plugin:enforce"`
- Expected: `"org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-enforcer-plugin:enforce@enforce"`

## Next Steps Needed
Find a way to completely bypass or disable the Develocity build cache system to allow fresh compilation of the modified source code.
