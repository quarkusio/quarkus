# Java Handles Everything - Clean Architecture

## Simple and Efficient ✅

Reverted to the clean approach: TypeScript sends all files to Java, Java handles batching.

## Architecture:

### TypeScript Side:
- Discovers all pom.xml files
- Filters out irrelevant files (maven-script, target/, etc.)
- Sends complete list to Java in one call
- Processes results

### Java Side (Already Optimized):
- Receives all file paths via stdin
- Processes files sequentially with memory management
- GC every 50 files
- Progress reporting every 50 files
- Reduced logging (every 10th file)
- Streams JSON output to file

## Benefits:
- ✅ **Simple architecture** - No complex TypeScript batching
- ✅ **Single process** - One Maven call handles everything
- ✅ **Java efficiency** - Memory management where it belongs
- ✅ **All projects processed** - No artificial limits
- ✅ **Optimal performance** - Java handles batching internally

## Usage:
```bash
# Processes all projects efficiently
nx graph --file graph.json
```

The Java analyzer already has all the batching and memory management built-in!
