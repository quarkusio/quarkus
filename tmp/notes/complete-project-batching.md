# Complete Project Batching Implementation

## Solution: Process ALL Projects in Manageable Batches ✅

No limits, no skipping - every project gets processed efficiently.

## Batching Strategy:

### Default Behavior:
- **100 projects per batch** (configurable)
- **500ms delay** between batches to prevent system overload
- **Progress reporting** for each batch
- **Error resilience** - failed batches don't stop processing

### Configuration Options:
```bash
# Default: 100 projects per batch
nx graph --file graph.json

# Custom batch size
NX_MAVEN_BATCH_SIZE=50 nx graph --file graph.json
NX_MAVEN_BATCH_SIZE=200 nx graph --file graph.json
```

## Example for Quarkus (1667 projects):
```
Processing 1667 projects in batches of 100...
Processing batch 1/17 (100 projects)
Batch 1 completed: 98 projects processed
Processing batch 2/17 (100 projects)
Batch 2 completed: 95 projects processed
...
Processing batch 17/17 (67 projects)
Batch 17 completed: 67 projects processed
Generated 1624 Maven project configurations
```

## Benefits:
- ✅ **All projects processed** - No artificial limits
- ✅ **System friendly** - Controlled resource usage
- ✅ **Progress visibility** - Clear batch progress
- ✅ **Error resilient** - Failed batches don't stop processing
- ✅ **Configurable** - Adjust batch size as needed
- ✅ **Memory efficient** - Each batch processed independently

Perfect for large Maven repositories like Quarkus!
