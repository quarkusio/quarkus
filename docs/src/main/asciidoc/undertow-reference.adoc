This document explains various Undertow features that you can use in Quarkus.

== Serving Static Resources

To serve static resources you must place them in the `META-INF/resources` directory of your application. This is because
Quarkus applications are jar files rather than war files, and this location is the standard location for resources in
jar files as defined by the Servlet spec.

== undertow-handlers.conf

You can make use of the Undertow predicate language using an `undertow-handlers.conf` file. This file should be placed
in the `META-INF` directory of your application jar. This file contains handlers defined using the
link:http://undertow.io/undertow-docs/undertow-docs-2.0.0/index.html#predicates-attributes-and-handlers[Undertow predicate language].

== CORS filter

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing] (CORS) is a mechanism that
allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource
was served.

Quarkus comes with a CORS filter which implements the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface and intercepts all incoming HTTP
requests. It can be enabled in the Quarkus configuration file, `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.http.cors=true
----

If the filter is enabled and an HTTP request is identified as cross-origin, the CORS policy and headers defined using the
following properties will be applied before passing the request on to its actual target (servlet, JAX-RS resource, etc.):

[cols="<m,<m,<2",options="header"]
|===
|Property Name|Default|Description
|quarkus.http.cors.origins||The comma-separated list of origins allowed for CORS. The filter allows any origin if this is not
set.
|quarkus.http.cors.methods||The comma-separated list of HTTP methods allowed for CORS. The filter allows any method if this is
not set.
|quarkus.http.cors.headers||The comma-separated list of HTTP headers allowed for CORS. The filter allows any header if this is
not set.
|quarkus.http.cors.exposed-headers||The comma-separated list of HTTP headers exposed in CORS.
|===

Here's what a full CORS filter configuration could look like:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.http.cors=true
quarkus.http.cors.origins=http://foo.com,http://www.bar.io
quarkus.http.cors.methods=GET,PUT,POST
quarkus.http.cors.headers=X-Custom
quarkus.http.cors.exposed-headers=Content-Disposition
----

[WARNING]
====
If you want to use the `keycloak` Quarkus extension in your project, you should configure CORS using the `keycloak` extension
configuration.
