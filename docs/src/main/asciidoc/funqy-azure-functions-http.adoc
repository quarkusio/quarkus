= Funqy HTTP binding with Azure Functions
:extension-status: preview

Use xref:funqy-http.adoc[Quarkus Funqy HTTP] binding with Microsoft Azure Functions to deploy your serverless Quarkus applications.
By integrating your Quarkus applications with Azure Functions, you can invoke multiple Funqy HTTP functions as one Azure function.

include::{includes}/extension-status.adoc[]

To build RESTful Quarkus applications, consider using the Quarkus implementation of Jakarta REST, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route support instead, as described in xref:azure-functions-http.adoc[Azure Functions with RESTEasy Reactive, Undertow, or Reactive Routes]. All of which can be easily integrated with Quarkus and Azure Functions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Quarkus Funqy HTTP with Azure Functions binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.
This is because Funqy needs to be portable across many different protocols and function providers and its HTTP binding is very basic.
With Funqy, you can lose REST features such as linking and the ability to use some HTTP features, for example, cache-control and conditional GETs.

== Get started

For more information about the HTTP frameworks in Quarkus that you can integrate with Azure Functions, including Funqy, see the following tutorial:
