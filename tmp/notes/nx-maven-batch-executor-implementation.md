# Nx Maven Batch Executor Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Maven batch executor that solves the session context problem while maintaining Nx's granular caching benefits.

## Key Innovation: Single Session Context
The breakthrough was using Maven Invoker API to execute multiple goals in a single Maven session, preserving artifact context between goals.

## Implementation Components

### 1. NxMavenBatchExecutor.java
- **Purpose**: Java application that executes Maven goals using Maven Invoker API
- **Key Feature**: Multiple goals share single Maven session
- **Output**: JSON results for Nx integration
- **Session Management**: Automatic artifact context preservation

### 2. Updated TargetGenerationService.java
- **Goal Targets**: Use batch executor for individual goals
- **Phase Targets**: Use batch executor for multiple goals in sequence
- **Command Pattern**: `java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* NxMavenBatchExecutor "goals" "projectRoot" verbose`

### 3. Maven POM Configuration
- **Added Dependency**: `maven-invoker` for programmatic Maven execution
- **Added Plugin**: `maven-dependency-plugin` to copy dependencies
- **Build Process**: Creates executable environment with all dependencies

## Architecture Benefits

### ✅ Granular Caching
- Each goal is still a separate Nx target
- Individual goals can be cached independently
- Nx manages dependencies between goals

### ✅ Maven Session Context
- Multiple goals share Maven session when executed together
- Artifacts from previous goals accessible to later goals
- Solves `maven-install-plugin:install` dependency on jar artifacts

### ✅ Unified Execution Model
- Single executor handles both individual goals and phase batches
- Consistent output format and error handling
- Per-goal timing and success/failure reporting

## Execution Examples

### Single Goal (Granular)
```bash
# Nx command
nx maven-jar:jar

# Generated command
java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* NxMavenBatchExecutor "maven-jar-plugin:jar" "." false
```

### Phase (Batch Multiple Goals)
```bash
# Nx command  
nx install

# Generated command
java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* NxMavenBatchExecutor "maven-resources-plugin:resources,maven-compiler-plugin:compile,maven-surefire-plugin:test,maven-jar-plugin:jar,maven-install-plugin:install" "." false
```

## Test Results

### ✅ Single Goal Test
```json
{
  "overallSuccess": true,
  "totalDurationMs": 5260,
  "goalResults": [
    {
      "goal": "org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:compile",
      "success": true,
      "durationMs": 5260,
      "exitCode": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Multi-Goal Test (Previously Failing)
```json
{
  "overallSuccess": true,
  "totalDurationMs": 2976,
  "goalResults": [
    {
      "goal": "org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-jar-plugin:jar,org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:install",
      "success": true,
      "durationMs": 2976,
      "exitCode": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Problem Solved
The `maven-install-plugin:install` goal now works because:
1. `maven-jar-plugin:jar` creates JAR and sets `project.getArtifact().setFile()`
2. `maven-install-plugin:install` runs in same session and can access the artifact
3. Both goals execute in single Maven Invoker session with shared context

## Final Architecture
- **Individual Goals**: Batch executor with single goal for granular caching
- **Phase Targets**: Batch executor with multiple goals for Maven compatibility  
- **Session Context**: Shared across all goals in single execution
- **Nx Integration**: Standard `nx:run-commands` executor with JSON output parsing

This implementation provides the optimal balance of Nx optimization benefits and Maven compatibility.
