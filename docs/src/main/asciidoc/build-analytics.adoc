= Build analytics
:categories: analytics
:summary: This guide presents what build analytics is and how to configure it.

The Quarkus team has limited knowledge, from Maven download numbers, of the remarkable growth of Quarkus and the number of users reporting issues/concerns. Still, we need more insight into the platforms, operating system, Java combinations, and build tools our users employ.
The build analytics tool aims to provide us with this information.

== How it works

*Collection happens only at build-time* and not at runtime. Collection occurs during usage of Quarkus build tooling (Maven, Gradle). Your built application does not contain any data collection code.

*All data collected is anonymous*. There is no way to link this data back to an individual or organization. The intent is to learn about general patterns and trends; therefore, only anonymous data is needed.

*Collection is disabled by default* You will be asked if you want to opt in to data collection the first time you use dev mode. The console will wait for a few seconds for your input.

== This is the data being collected

* Anonymous application name. SHA-256 hash of the Group Id + Artifact Id.
* Anonymous application version. SHA-256 hash of the Artifact Id + Version.
* Anonymous user id. During the 1st build, this is generated locally at random, and subsequently reused.
* Quarkus version
* Java version
* GraalVM version
* Operating system details: OS name, OS version and architecture
* Build system details, such as Maven, Gradle, and so on.
* If a CI system was detected
* Country and timezone
* Extensions enabled. Only extensions whose `groupIds` start with `io.quarkus`, `io.quarkiverse` or are included in the quarkus platform are collected.

And here is an example of the data payload being sent:

== Where are the config files?
Analytics configurations are stored at the `.redhat` folder in the user's home directory:

`anonymousId` is the locally generated anonymous user id.

`io.quarkus.analytics.localconfig` holds if the user has agreed to send analytics data or not.

`io.quarkus.analytics.remoteconfig` cache of the remote configuration that allows to disable analytics globally.

== Show me the code!

The bulk of the code is implemented in the `analytics-common` module. Data is sent using calls to `io.quarkus.analytics.AnalyticsService.sendAnalytics(...)` from the Maven and Gradle plugins.

The uploaded events are stored under the project's `/target` folder with the name `build-analytics-event.json`.

== How to disable analytics?

*Build time analytics is not active by default.*

If you have opted in and would like to disable build time analytics, you can do so in two ways:

* Globally, by editing the `io.quarkus.analytics.localconfig` file in the '.redhat' folder of your userâ€™s home directory. Update the file as follows:
[source,json]
----
{"disabled":true}
----

* Per project, by using the system property `quarkus.analytics.disabled=true` when building the project.

[source,bash]
.Example using maven
----
mvn clean install -Dquarkus.analytics.disabled=true
----

== Configuration
// Build telemetry runs outside quarkus, therefore no @ConfigRoot to generate the config part

|===
| Configuration property | Type | Default

| [[build-analytics.quarkus.analytics.disabled]]`link:#build-analytics.quarkus.analytics.disabled[quarkus.analytics.disabled]`

Values can be `true` or `false`.

Setting this property to `true` will disable the collection of analytics data on that specific project regardless of any other configuration.
| boolean
| false
| [[build-analytics.quarkus.analytics.uri.base]]`link:#build-analytics.quarkus.analytics.uri.base[quarkus.analytics.uri.base]`

Base URL of the analytics service. This is were all the data is sent to.
| String
| "https://api.segment.io/"
| [[build-analytics.quarkus.analytics.timeout]]`link:#build-analytics.quarkus.analytics.timeout[quarkus.analytics.timeout]`

Value in milliseconds for the timeout of the HTTP request to submit the analytics service.
| int
| 3000
