= {project-name} - Sending emails

This guide demonstrates how your {project-name} application can send emails using an SMTP server.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* The SMTP hostname, port and credentials, and an email address
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* GraalVM installed if you want to run in native mode.

== Architecture

In this guide, we are going to see how you can send emails from a {project-name} application.
It covers simple emails, attachments, inlined attachments, the reactive and imperative APIs...

== Creating the Maven Project

Create a new project with the following command:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=sending-email-quickstart \
    -Dextensions="mailer"
----

If you already have an existing project, add the `mailer` extension:

[source]
----
mvn quarkus:add-extensions -Dextensions="mailer"
----

== Configuring the mailer

The {project-name} mailer is using SMTP. In the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file, you need to configure the host, port, username, password as well as the other configuration aspect.
Note that the password can also be configured using system properties and environment variables.

Here is an example using _sendgrid_:

[source]
----
quarkus.mailer.from=test@quarkus.io
quarkus.mailer.host=smtp.sendgrid.net
quarkus.mailer.port=465
quarkus.mailer.ssl=true
quarkus.mailer.username=....
quarkus.mailer.password=....
----

The following table lists the properties that can be configured:

[cols=*,options="header"]
|===

| Property | Type | Comment | Default

| from | String | the default _from_ address, without, all emails will need an explicit value |
| mock | Boolean | if set to `true`, the emails are not sent, just printed on the console. | `false`
| bounce-address | String | the default bounce address |
| host | String | the SMTP server host name | _mandatory_
| port | Integer | the SMTP server port | `25`
| username | String | the username |
| password | String | the password |
| ssl | Boolean | Enables or disables SSL | `false`
| trust-all | Boolean | Set whether to trust all certificates | `false`
| max-pool-size | Integer | Configures the maximum number of open connections to the mail server | `10`
| own-host-name | String | The hostname to be used for `HELO/EHLO` and the `Message-ID` |
| keep-alive | Boolean | Set if connection pool is enabled. | `true`
| disable-esmtp | Boolean | Disable ESMTP | `false`
| start-tls | `NONE`, `OPTIONAL`, `REQUIRED` | Set the TLS security mode | `OPTIONAL`
| login | `DISABLED`, `OPTIONAL`, `REQUIRED` | Set the login mode for the connection | `NONE`
| auth-methods | space-separated list | Set the allowed auth methods, accept all methods if not set |
| key-store | String | Path of the key store |
| key-store-password | String | Key store password |
|===

== Sending simple emails

In a JAX-RS resource, or in a bean, you can inject the mailer as follows:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
Mailer mailer;

@Inject
ReactiveMailer reactiveMailer;
----

There are 2 APIs:

* `io.quarkus.mailer.Mailer` provides the imperative (blocking and synchronous) API;
* `io.quarkus.mailer.ReactiveMailer` provides the reactive (non-blocking and asynchronous) API

NOTE: The two APIs are equivalent feature-wise. Actually the `Mailer` implementation is built on top of the `ReactiveMailer` implementation.

To send a simple email, proceed as follows:

[source, java]
----
// Imperative API:
mailer.send(Mail.withText("to@acme.org", "A simple email from quarkus", "This is my body."));
// Reactive API:
CompletionStage<Void> stage = reactiveMailer.send(Mail.withText("to@acme.org", "A reactive email from quarkus", "This is my body."));
----

For example, you can use the `Mailer` in a JAX-RS endpoint as follows:

[source, java]
----
@GET
@Path("/simple")
public Response sendASimpleEmail() {
    mailer.send(Mail.withText("to@acme.org", "A simple email from quarkus", "This is my body"));
    return Response.accepted().build();
}

@GET
@Path("/async")
public CompletionStage<Response> sendASimpleEmailAsync() {
    return reactiveMailer.send(
            Mail.withText("to@acme.org", "A reactive email from quarkus", "This is my body"))
            .thenApply(x -> Response.accepted().build());
}
----

With such a JAX-RS resource, you can check that everything is working with:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/simple
curl http://localhost:8080/async
----

You can create new `io.quarkus.mailer.Mail` instances from the constructor or from the `Mail.withText` and
`Mail.withHtml` helper methods. The `Mail` instance lets you add recipients (to, cc, or bcc), set the subject,
headers, sender (from) address...

You can also send several `Mail` objects in one call:

[source, java]
----
mailer.send(mail1, mail2, mail3);
----

== Sending attachments

To send attachment, just use the `addAttachment` methods on the `io.quarkus.mailer.Mail` instance:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/attachment")
public Response sendEmailWithAttachment() {
    mailer.send(Mail.withText("to@acme.org", "An email from quarkus with attachment",
            "This is my body")
            .addAttachment("my-file.txt",
                "content of my file".getBytes(), "text/plain"));
    return Response.accepted().build();
}
----

Attachments can be created from raw bytes (as shown in the snippet) or files.

== Sending HTML emails with inlined attachments

When sending HTML email, you can add inlined attachments.
For example, you can send an image with your email, and this image will be displayed in the mail content.

[source, java]
----
@GET
@Path("/html")
public Response sendingHTML() {
    String body = "<strong>Hello!</strong>" + "\n" +
        "<p>Here is an image for you: <img src=\"cid:my-image@quarkus.io\"/></p>" +
        "<p>Regards</p>";
    mailer.send(Mail.withHtml("to@acme.org", "An email in HTML", body)
        .addInlineAttachment("quarkus-logo.png",
            new File("quarkus-logo.png"),
            "image/png", "<my-image@quarkus.io>"));
    return Response.accepted().build();
}
----

Note the _content-id_ format and reference.
By spec, when you create the inline attachment, the content-id must be structured as follows: `<id@domain>`.
If you don't wrap your content-id between `<>`, it is automatically wrapped for you.
When you want to reference your attachment, for instance in the `src` attribute, use `cid:id@domain` (without the `<` and `>`).

== Using the underlying Vert.x Mail Client

The Quarkus Mailer is implemented on top of the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-mail-client/java/[Vert.x Mail Client], providing an asynchronous and non-blocking way to send emails.
If you need fine control on how the mail is sent, for instance if you need to retrieve the message ids, you can inject the underlying client, and use it directly:

[source, java]
----
@Inject MailClient client;
----

Three API flavors are exposed:

* the Axle client (`io.vertx.axle.ext.mail.MailClient`), using `CompletionStage` and Reactive Streams `Publisher`
* the RX Java 2 client (`io.vertx.reactivex.ext.mail.MailClient`)
* the bare client (`io.vertx.ext.mail.MailClient`)

Check the link:using-vertx.html[Using Vert.x guide] for further details about these different APIs and how to select the most suitable for you.

The retrieved `MailClient` is configured using the configuration key presented above.
You can also create your own instance, and pass your own configuration.


== Conclusion

This guide has shown how you can send emails from a Quarkus application.
The _mailer_ extension works in JVM and native mode.
