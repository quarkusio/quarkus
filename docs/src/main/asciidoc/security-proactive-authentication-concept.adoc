= Proactive authentication
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:diataxis-type: concept

Proactive authentication is enabled in Quarkus by default. This means that if an incoming request has a credential then that request will always be authenticated, even if the target page does not require authentication.

[[proactive-authentication]]

Requests with an invalid credential will always be rejected, even when the page is public. 

You can change the default behavior if you only want to authenticate when the target page requires authentication.

To disable proactive authentication in Quarkus, set the following attribute in the `application.properties` configuration file: 

[source,xml,options="nowrap",role="white-space-pre"]
----
`quarkus.http.auth.proactive=false` 
----

If you disable proactive authentication, the authentication process runs only when an identity is requested. An identity can be requested because of security rules that require the user to authenticate or because programmatic access to the current identity is required.

If proactive authentication is in use, accessing the `SecurityIdentity` is a blocking operation. 
This is because authentication may have yet to happen, and accessing it may require calls to external systems, such as databases that may block.
For blocking applications, this is no problem. However, if you have disabled authentication in a reactive application, this will fail (as you cannot do blocking operations on the IO thread).
To work around this, you need to `@Inject` an instance of `io.quarkus.security.identity.CurrentIdentityAssociation` and call the `Uni<SecurityIdentity> getDeferredIdentity();` method.
You can then subscribe to the resulting `Uni` and will be notified when authentication is complete and the identity is available.

NOTE: It's still possible to access the `SecurityIdentity` synchronously with `public SecurityIdentity getIdentity()` in the xref:resteasy-reactive.adoc[RESTEasy Reactive] from endpoints annotated with `@RolesAllowed`, `@Authenticated`, or with respective configuration authorization checks as authentication has already happened.
The same is also valid for the xref:reactive-routes.adoc[Reactive routes] if a route response is synchronous.

xref:security-authorization.adoc#standard-security-annotations[Standard security annotations] on CDI beans are not supported on IO thread if a non-void secured method returns a value synchronously and proactive authentication is disabled, as they need to access the `SecurityIdentity`.
In the example below, we have defined `HelloResource` and `HelloService`. It's easy to see that any GET request to `/hello` will run on IO thread and throw `BlockingOperationNotAllowedException` exception.

There is more than one way to fix the example:

* switch to a worker thread (annotate `hello` endpoint with `@Blocking`)
* change `sayHello` method return type (use reactive or asynchronous data type)
* arguably the safest way is to move `@RolesAllowed` annotation to the endpoint, as accessing `SecurityIdentity` from endpoint methods is never the blocking operation

import jakarta.annotation.security.PermitAll;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

@Path("/hello")
@PermitAll
public class HelloResource {

    @Inject
    HelloService helloService;

    @GET
    public Uni<String> hello() {
        return Uni.createFrom().item(helloService.sayHello());
    }

}

[source,java]

import jakarta.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloService {

    @RolesAllowed("admin")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello";
    }

== How to customize authentication exception responses

You can use Jakarta REST `ExceptionMapper` to capture Quarkus Security authentication exceptions such as `io.quarkus.security.AuthenticationFailedException`, for example:

[source,java]
----
package io.quarkus.it.keycloak;

import jakarta.annotation.Priority;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Priorities;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Response;
import jakarta.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper;
import jakarta.ws.rs.ext.Provider;

import io.quarkus.security.AuthenticationFailedException;

@Provider
@Priority(Priorities.AUTHENTICATION)
public class AuthenticationFailedExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<AuthenticationFailedException> {

    @Context
    UriInfo uriInfo;

    @Override
    public Response toResponse(AuthenticationFailedException exception) {
        return Response.status(401).header("WWW-Authenticate", "Basic realm=\"Quarkus\"").build();
    }
}
----

CAUTION: Some HTTP authentication mechanisms need to handle authentication exceptions themselves to create a correct authentication challenge.
For example, `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.CodeAuthenticationMechanism` which manages OpenId Connect authorization code flow authentication, needs to build a correct redirect URL, cookies, etc.
For that reason, using custom exception mappers to customize authentication exceptions thrown by such mechanisms is not recommended.
Instead, a safer approach would be to ensure that proactive authentication is enabled and to use Vert.x HTTP route failure handlers. This is because events come to the handler with the correct response status and headers.
You will then only need to customize the response, as outlined in the following example:

[source,java]
----
package io.quarkus.it.keycloak;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.enterprise.event.Observes;

import io.quarkus.security.AuthenticationFailedException;
import io.vertx.core.Handler;
import io.vertx.ext.web.Router;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
public class AuthenticationFailedExceptionHandler {

    public void init(@Observes Router router) {
        router.route().failureHandler(new Handler<RoutingContext>() {
            @Override
            public void handle(RoutingContext event) {
                if (event.failure() instanceof AuthenticationFailedException) {
                    event.response().end("CUSTOMIZED_RESPONSE");
                } else {
                    event.next();
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
