/**
 * {@link WebSocket} and {@link WebSocketClient} endpoint methods annotated with this annotation consume pong messages. An
 * endpoint may declare at most one method annotated with this annotation.
 *
 * <h2>Execution model</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Methods annotated with {@link io.smallrye.common.annotation.RunOnVirtualThread} are considered blocking and should be
 * executed on a virtual thread.</li>
 * <li>Methods annotated with {@link io.smallrye.common.annotation.Blocking} are considered blocking and should be executed on a
 * worker thread.</li>
 * <li>Methods annotated with {@link io.smallrye.common.annotation.NonBlocking} are considered non-blocking and should be
 * executed on an event loop thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Execution model for methods which don't declare any of the annotation listed above is derived from the return type:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Methods returning {@code void} are considered blocking and should be executed on a worker thread.</li>
 * <li>Methods returning {@code io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni<Void>} are considered non-blocking and should be executed on an event
 * loop thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Method parameters</h2>
 *
 * The method must accept exactly one pong message parameter represented as a {@link io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer}. The method
 * may also accept the following parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link WebSocketConnection}/{@link WebSocketClientConnection}; depending on the endpoint type</li>
 * <li>{@link HandshakeRequest}</li>
 * <li>{@link String} parameters annotated with {@link PathParam}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
