= {project-name} - Infinispan Client

Infinispan is an in memory data grid that allows running in a server outside of application processes. This extension
provides functionality to allow the client that can connect to said server when running in {project-name}.

More information can be found about Infinispan at http://www.infinispan.org and the client/server at
http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#client_server

== Configuration

Once you have your {project-name} project configured you can add the `infinispan-client` extension
to your project by running the following from the command line in your project base directory.

[source]
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="infinispan-client"

This will add the following to your pom.xml

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-infinispan-client-deployment</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

The Infinispan client is configurable in the `microprofile-config.properties` file that can be
provided in the `META-INF` directory. These are the properties that
can be configured in this file:

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Property
| Default Value
| Description

| `quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list`
| <empty>
| Defines the list of servers to connect to upon startup. This allows for multiple servers separated by a semicolon
for each. (eg. host1:11222;host:11222)

| `quarkus.infinispan-client.near-cache-max-entries`
| 0
| Controls whether the near cache is enabled (allowing repeated retrievals to be stored).
If this value is zero or less near cache is disabled. A value greater than zero enables near
cache and only that many entries will be held a time, removing older entries to save memory
(per cache).

|===

It is also possible to configure a `hotrod-client.properties` as described in the Infinispan user guide. Note that
the `hotrod-client.properties` values overwrite any matching property from the other configuration values (eg. near cache).

== Serialization (Key Value types support)

By default the client will support keys and values of the following types: byte[],
primitive wrappers (eg. Integer, Long, Double etc.), String, Date and Instant. User types require
some additional steps that are detailed here. Let's say we have the following user classes:

.Author.java
----
public class Author {
   private final String name;
   private final String surname;

   public Author(String name, String surname) {
      this.name = Objects.requireNonNull(name);
      this.surname = Objects.requireNonNull(surname);
   }
   // Getter/Setter/equals/hashCode/toString ommitted
}
----

.Book.java
----
public class Book {
   private final String title;
   private final String description;
   private final int publicationYear;
   private final Set<Author> authors;

   public Book(String title, String description, int publicationYear, Set<Author> authors) {
      this.title = Objects.requireNonNull(title);
      this.description = Objects.requireNonNull(description);
      this.publicationYear = publicationYear;
      this.authors = Objects.requireNonNull(authors);
   }
   // Getter/Setter/equals/hashCode/toString ommitted
}
----

The default serialization is done using a library based on protobuf. We need to define the proto
buf schema and a marshaller for each user type(s).

NOTE: Annotation based proto stream marshalling is not yet supported in
the {project-name} Infinispan client. This will be added soon, allowing you to only annotate your classes,
skipping the following steps.

Protobuf schema:: You can supply a protobuf schema through either one of two ways.
  . Proto File
  +
  You can put the `.proto` file in the `META-INF` directory of the project. These files will
automatically be picked up at initialization time.
+
.library.proto
----
package book_sample;

message Book {
  required string title = 1;
  required string description = 2;
  required int32 publicationYear = 3; // no native Date type available in Protobuf

  repeated Author authors = 4;
}

message Author {
  required string name = 1;
  required string surname = 2;
}
----
  . In Code
  +
  Or you can define the proto schema directly in user code by defining a produced bean of type
`org.infinispan.protostream.FileDescriptorSource`.
+
[source,java]
----
   @Produces
   FileDescriptorSource bookProtoDefinition() {
      return FileDescriptorSource.fromString("library.proto", "package book_sample;\n" +
            "\n" +
            "message Book {\n" +
            "  required string title = 1;\n" +
            "  required string description = 2;\n" +
            "  required int32 publicationYear = 3; // no native Date type available in Protobuf\n" +
            "\n" +
            "  repeated Author authors = 4;\n" +
            "}\n" +
            "\n" +
            "message Author {\n" +
            "  required string name = 1;\n" +
            "  required string surname = 2;\n" +
            "}");
   }
----
User Marshaller::
The last thing to do is to provide a `org.infinispan.protostream.MessageMarshaller` implementation
for each user class defined in the proto schema. This class is then provided via `@Produces` in a similar
fashion to the code based proto schema definition above.
+
Here is the Marshaller class for our Author & Book classes.
+
NOTE: The type name must match the `<protobuf package>.<protobuf message>` exactly!
+
.AuthorMarshaller.java
----
public class AuthorMarshaller implements MessageMarshaller<Author> {

   @Override
   public String getTypeName() {
      return "book_sample.Author";
   }

   @Override
   public Class<? extends Author> getJavaClass() {
      return Author.class;
   }

   @Override
   public void writeTo(ProtoStreamWriter writer, Author author) throws IOException {
      writer.writeString("name", author.getName());
      writer.writeString("surname", author.getSurname());
   }

   @Override
   public Author readFrom(ProtoStreamReader reader) throws IOException {
      String name = reader.readString("name");
      String surname = reader.readString("surname");
      return new Author(name, surname);
   }
}
----
+
.BookMarshaller.java
----
public class BookMarshaller implements MessageMarshaller<Book> {

   @Override
   public String getTypeName() {
      return "book_sample.Book";
   }

   @Override
   public Class<? extends Book> getJavaClass() {
      return Book.class;
   }

   @Override
   public void writeTo(ProtoStreamWriter writer, Book book) throws IOException {
      writer.writeString("title", book.getTitle());
      writer.writeString("description", book.getDescription());
      writer.writeInt("publicationYear", book.getPublicationYear());
      writer.writeCollection("authors", book.getAuthors(), Author.class);
   }

   @Override
   public Book readFrom(ProtoStreamReader reader) throws IOException {
      String title = reader.readString("title");
      String description = reader.readString("description");
      int publicationYear = reader.readInt("publicationYear");
      Set<Author> authors = reader.readCollection("authors", new HashSet<>(), Author.class);
      return new Book(title, description, publicationYear, authors);
   }
}
----
+
And you pass the marshaller by defining the following:
+
[source,java]
----
   @Produces
   MessageMarshaller authorMarshaller() {
      return new AuthorMarshaller();
   }

   @Produces
   MessageMarshaller bookMarshaller() {
      return new BookMarshaller();
   }
----

NOTE: Annotation based proto stream marshalling is not yet supported in
the {project-name} infinispan client.

=== Providing your own Marshaller

You can implement the `org.infinispan.commons.marshaller.Marshaller` interface. This will allow you
to put keys and values of the types it supports directly with the client. All that is required is to have your
class available in classpath and configure the property value to be the fully qualified class name. This
method does not require any optional dependencies.

It is recommended to extend from the `org.infinispan.commons.marshall.AbstractMarshaller` class to reduce
the lines of the class. Here is an example of a Marshaller implementation for String instances.

With that class in your project/classpath, all you need to do is add the following to your
hotrod-client.properties as mentioned above.

[source]
infinispan.client.hotrod.marshaller=com.example.MyMarshaller

Note that the Marshaller implementation must have a no arg constructor or static factory method named
`getInstance`.

== Dependency Injection

As you saw above we support the user injecting Marshaller configuration. You can do the inverse with
the infinispan client extension providing injection for `RemoteCacheManager` and `RemoteCache` objects.
There is one global `RemoteCacheManager` that takes all of the configuration
parameters setup in the above sections.

It is very simple to inject these components. All you need to do is to add the Inject annotation to
the field, constructor or method. In the below code we utilize field and constructor injection.

.SomeClass.java
----
    @Inject SomeClass(RemoteCacheManager remoteCacheManager) {
       this.remoteCacheManager = remoteCacheManager;
    }

    @Inject @Remote("myCache")
    RemoteCache<String, Book> cache;

    RemoteCacheManager remoteCacheManager;
----

If you notice the `RemoteCache` declaration has an additional optional annotation named `Remote`.
This is a qualifier annotation allowing you to specify which named cache that will be injected. This
annotation is not required and if it is not supplied, the default cache will be injected.

NOTE: Other types may be supported for injection, please see other sections for more information

== Querying

The Infinispan client supports both indexed and non indexed querying as long as the 
`ProtoStreamMarshaller` is configured above. This allows the user to query based on the
properties of the proto schema.

Query builds upon the proto definitions you can configure when setting up the `ProtoStreamMarshaller`.
Make sure to configure this marshaller before attempting querying. Once this is completed
you must add another optional depdency: `infinispan-query-dsl` to start using queries.

You can do this by adding the following dependency to your project.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.infinispan</groupId>
    <artifactId>infinispan-query-dsl</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

With this added you can use Infinispan querying just as you would normally, nothing special required.
You can read more about this at http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#query_dsl.

You can use either the Query DSL or the Ickle Query language with the {project-name} infinispan client
extension.

== Counters

Infinispan also has a notion of counters and the {project-name} infinispan client supports them out of
the box.

The {project-name} infinispan client extension allows for Dependency Injection
of the `CounterManager` directly. All you need to do is annotate your field, constructor or method
and you get it with no fuss. You can then use counters as you would normally.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
CounterManager counterManager;
----

== Near Caching

Near caching is disabled by default, but you can enable it by setting the profile config property
`quarkus.infinispan-client.near-cache-max-entries` to a value greater than 0. You can also configure
a regular expression so that only a subset of caches have near caching applied through the
`quarkus.infinispan-client.near-cache-name-pattern` attribute.

== Encryption

Encryption at this point requires additional steps to get working.

The first step is to configure the `hotrod-client.properties` file to point to your truststore
and/or keystore. This is further detailed at
http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#hr_encryption.

The reason that {project-name} is different is that SubstrateVM does not come with security
services enabled. This is mentioned at
https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/JCA-SECURITY-SERVICES.md. To
do this you will need to set the `<enableAllSecurityServices>true</enableAllSecurityServices>` value
in the `quarkus-maven-plugin` configuration values.

An example is as shown here, with a comment highlighting them:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
   <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
   <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <executions>
       <execution>
           <id>native-image</id>
           <goals>
               <goal>native-image</goal>
           </goals>
           <configuration>
               <enableHttpUrlHandler>true</enableHttpUrlHandler>
               <!-- next two are to enable security - If not needed it is recommended not to enable these-->
               <enableJni>true</enableJni>
               <enableAllSecurityServices>true</enableAllSecurityServices>
           </configuration>
       </execution>
   </executions>
</plugin>
----

If you notice the example XML above also enabled JNI. This is currently needed depending on the
configured security provider. If JNI is required then you must locate the shared library used. In
testing it was utilizing the `sunec` library. This shared library
should be at `<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/<platform>/libsunec.so` and must be added to `java.library.path`
for encryption to work properly.

== Authentication

This chart illustrates what mechanisms have been verified to be working properly with
the {project-name} Infinispan Client extension.

.Mechanisms
|===
| Name | Verified | Notes

| DIGEST-MD5
| [green]*Y*
|

| PLAIN
| [green]*Y*
|

| EXTERNAL
| [green]*Y*
| Requires steps from Encryption section above

| GSSAPI
| [red]*N*
| Not tested

| Custom
| [red]*N*
| Not tested

|===

The guide for configuring these can be found at http://infinispan.org/docs/dev/user_guide/user_guide.html#authentication.
However you need to configure these through the `hotrod-client.properties` file if using Dependency Injection.

== Additional Features

The Infinispan Client has additional features that were not mentioned here. This means this
feature was not tested in a {project-name} environment and they may or may not work. Please let us
know if you need these added!
