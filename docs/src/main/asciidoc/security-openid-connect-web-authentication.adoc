:categories: security
:summary: This guide demonstrates how to use the OpenID Connect Extension to protect your web application based on the Authorization Code Flow using Quarkus.
:toc:

The Quarkus OpenID Connect (OIDC) extension can protect application HTTP endpoints by using the OIDC Authorization Code Flow mechanism supported by OIDC-compliant authorization servers, such as https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak].

The Authorization Code Flow mechanism authenticates users of your web application by redirecting them to an OIDC provider, such as Keycloak, to log in. 
After authentication, the OIDC provider redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code that confirms that authentication was successful. Then, the application exchanges this code with the OIDC provider for an ID token (which represents the authenticated user), an access token, and a refresh token to authorize the user's access to the application. 

The following diagram outlines the Authorization Code Flow mechanism in Quarkus.

.Authorization code flow mechanism in Quarkus
image::authorization_code_flow.png[alt=Authorization Code Flow, width="60%", align=center]
. The Quarkus user requests access to a Quarkus web-app application.
. The Quarkus web-app redirects the user to the authorization endpoint, that is, the OIDC provider for authentication.
. The OIDC provider redirects the user to a login and authentication prompt.
. At the prompt, the user enters their user credentials.
. The OIDC provider authenticates the user credentials entered and, if successful, issues an authorization code then redirects the user back to the Quarkus web-app with the code included as a query parameter.
. The Quarkus web-app exchanges this authorization code with the OIDC provider for ID, access, and refresh tokens. 

The authorization code flow is completed and the Quarkus web-app uses the tokens issued to access information about the user and grant the relevant role-based authorization to that user. 
The following tokens are issued: 

* ID token: The Quarkus web-app uses the user information in the ID token to enable the authenticated user to log in securely and to provide role-based access to the web-app. 
* Access token: The Quarkus web-app might use the access token to access the UserInfo API to get additional information about the authenticated user or propagate it to another endpoint.
* Refresh token: (Optional) If the ID and access tokens expire, the Quarkus web-app can use the refresh token to get new ID and access tokens.  

For information about protecting your applications using Bearer Token authorization, see xref:security-openid-connect.adoc[Using OpenID Connect to Protect Service Applications].

For information about multitenant support, see xref:security-openid-connect-multitenancy.adoc[Using OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy].

== Quickstart

=== Prerequisites

:prerequisites-docker:
include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]

=== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple web application with a single page:

* `/index.html`

This page is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.

=== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart[directory].

=== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

:create-app-artifact-id: security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart
:create-app-extensions: resteasy-reactive,oidc
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `oidc` extension
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

:add-extension-extensions: oidc
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

This will add the following to your build file:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-oidc")
----

=== Writing the application

Let's write a simple JAX-RS resource which has all the tokens returned in the authorization code grant response injected:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.openid.connect.web.authentication;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;

import io.quarkus.oidc.IdToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.RefreshToken;

@Path("/tokens")
public class TokenResource {

    /**
     * Injection point for the ID Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
     */
    @Inject
    @IdToken
    JsonWebToken idToken;

    /**
     * Injection point for the Access Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
     */
    @Inject
    JsonWebToken accessToken;

    /**
     * Injection point for the Refresh Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
     */
    @Inject
    RefreshToken refreshToken;

    /**
     * Returns the tokens available to the application. This endpoint exists only for demonstration purposes, you should not
     * expose these tokens in a real application.
     *
     * @return a HTML page containing the tokens available to the application
     */
    @GET
    @Produces("text/html")
    public String getTokens() {
        StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder().append("<html>")
                .append("<body>")
                .append("<ul>");

        Object userName = this.idToken.getClaim("preferred_username");

        if (userName != null) {
            response.append("<li>username: ").append(userName.toString()).append("</li>");
        }

        Object scopes = this.accessToken.getClaim("scope");

        if (scopes != null) {
            response.append("<li>scopes: ").append(scopes.toString()).append("</li>");
        }

        response.append("<li>refresh_token: ").append(refreshToken.getToken() != null).append("</li>");

        return response.append("</ul>").append("</body>").append("</html>").toString();
    }
}
----

This endpoint has ID, access and refresh tokens injected. It returns a `preferred_username` claim from the ID token, a `scope` claim from the access token and also a refresh token availability status.

Note that you do not have to inject the tokens - it is only required if the endpoint needs to use the ID token to interact with the currently authenticated user or use the access token to access a downstream service on behalf of this user.

Please see <<access_id_and_access_tokens,Access ID and Access Tokens>> section below for more information.

=== Configuring the application

The OpenID Connect extension allows you to define the configuration using the `application.properties` file which should be located at the `src/main/resources` directory.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated
----

This is the simplest configuration you can have when enabling authentication to your application. 

The `quarkus.oidc.client-id` property references the `client_id` issued by the OpenID Connect Provider and the `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret` property sets the client secret.

The `quarkus.oidc.application-type` property is set to `web-app` in order to tell Quarkus that you want to enable the OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow, so that your users are redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to authenticate.

For last, the `quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated` permission is set to tell Quarkus about the paths you want to protect. In this case,
all paths are being protected by a policy that ensures that only `authenticated` users are allowed to access. For more details check xref:security-authorization.adoc[Security Authorization Guide].

=== Starting and Configuring the Keycloak Server

To start a Keycloak Server you can use Docker and just run the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin -p 8180:8080 quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:{keycloak.version} start-dev
----

where `keycloak.version` should be set to `17.0.0` or higher.

You should be able to access your Keycloak Server at http://localhost:8180[localhost:8180].

Log in as the `admin` user to access the Keycloak Administration Console. Username should be `admin` and password `admin`.

Import the {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] to create a new realm. For more details, see the Keycloak documentation about how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_create-realm[create a new realm].

=== Running the Application in Dev and JVM modes

To run the application in a dev mode, use:

include::{includes}/devtools/dev.adoc[]

When you're done playing with dev mode you can run it as a standard Java application.

First compile it:

include::{includes}/devtools/build.adoc[]

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

=== Running the Application in Native Mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code: no modifications required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your
production environment, as the runtime technology is included in
the produced binary, and optimized to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compilation will take a bit longer, so this step is disabled by default;
let's build again by enabling the native build:

include::{includes}/devtools/build-native.adoc[]

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart-runner
----

=== Testing the Application

To test the application, you should open your browser and access the following URL:

* http://localhost:8080/tokens[http://localhost:8080/tokens]

If everything is working as expected, you should be redirected to the Keycloak server to authenticate.

In order to authenticate to the application you should type the following credentials when at the Keycloak login page:

* Username: *alice*
* Password: *alice*

After clicking the `Login` button you should be redirected back to the application.

Please also see the <<integration-testing-keycloak-devservices, Dev Services for Keycloak>> section below about writing the integration tests which depend on `Dev Services for Keycloak`.

== Reference Guide

[[access_id_and_access_tokens]]
=== Accessing ID and Access Tokens

OIDC Code Authentication Mechanism acquires three tokens during the authorization code flow: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[IDToken], Access Token and Refresh Token.

ID Token is always a JWT token and is used to represent a user authentication with the JWT claims.
One can access ID Token claims by injecting `JsonWebToken` with an `IdToken` qualifier:

[source, java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.IdToken;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    @IdToken
    JsonWebToken idToken;

    @GET
    public String getUserName() {
        return idToken.getName();
    }
}
----

Access Token is usually used by the OIDC `web-app` application to access other endpoints on behalf of the currently logged-in user. The raw access token can be accessed as follows:

[source, java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.AccessTokenCredential;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    JsonWebToken accessToken;

    // or
    // @Inject
    // AccessTokenCredential accessTokenCredential;

    @GET
    public String getReservationOnBehalfOfUser() {
        String rawAccessToken = accessToken.getRawToken();
        //or
        //String rawAccessToken = accessTokenCredential.getToken();

        // Use the raw access token to access a remote endpoint
        return getReservationfromRemoteEndpoint(rawAccesstoken);
    }
}
----

Note that `AccessTokenCredential` will have to be used if the Access Token issued to the Quarkus `web-app` application is opaque (binary) and can not be parsed to `JsonWebToken`.

Injection of the `JsonWebToken` and `AccessTokenCredential` is supported in both `@RequestScoped` and `@ApplicationScoped` contexts.

RefreshToken is only used to refresh the current ID and access tokens as part of its <<session-management,session management>> process.

[[user-info]]
=== User Info

If IdToken does not provide enough information about the currently authenticated user then you can set a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.user-info-required=true` property for a https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo] JSON object from the OIDC userinfo endpoint to be requested.

A request will be sent to the OpenID Provider UserInfo endpoint using the access token returned with the authorization code grant response and an `io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo` (a simple `javax.json.JsonObject` wrapper) object will be created. `io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo` can be either injected or accessed as a SecurityIdentity `userinfo` attribute.

[[config-metadata]]
=== Configuration Metadata

The current tenant's discovered link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata[OpenID Connect Configuration Metadata] is represented by `io.quarkus.oidc.OidcConfigurationMetadata` and can be either injected or accessed as a `SecurityIdentity` `configuration-metadata` attribute.

The default tenant's `OidcConfigurationMetadata` is injected if the endpoint is public.

[[token-claims-roles]]
=== Token Claims And SecurityIdentity Roles

The way the roles are mapped to the SecurityIdentity roles from the verified tokens is identical to how it is done for the xref:security-openid-connect.adoc#token-claims-and-securityidentity-roles[bearer tokens] with the only difference being is that https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[ID Token] is used as a source of the roles by default.

Note if you use Keycloak then you should set a Microprofile JWT client scope for ID token to contain a `groups` claim, please see the https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#protocol[Keycloak Server Administration Guide] for more information.

If only the access token contains the roles and this access token is not meant to be propagated to the downstream endpoints then set `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`.

If UserInfo is the source of the roles then set `quarkus.oidc.authentication.user-info-required=true` and `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=userinfo`, and if needed, `quarkus.oidc.roles.role-claim-path`.

Additionally, a custom `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` can also be used to add the roles as documented xref:security.adoc#security-identity-customization[here].

[[token-verification-introspection]]
=== Token Verification And Introspection

Please see xref:security-openid-connect.adoc#token-verification-introspection[Token Verification And Introspection] for details about how the tokens are verified and introspected.

Note that in case of `web-app` applications only `IdToken` is verified by default since the access token is not used by default to access the current Quarkus `web-app` endpoint and instead meant to be propagated to the services expecting this access token, for example, to the OpenID Connect Provider's UserInfo endpoint, etc. However, if you expect the access token to contain the roles required to access the current Quarkus endpoint (`quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`) then it will also be verified.

[[token-introspection-userinfo-cache]]
=== Token Introspection and UserInfo Cache

Code flow access tokens are not introspected unless they are expected to be the source of roles but will be used to get `UserInfo`. So there will be one or two remote calls with the code flow access token, if the token introspection and/or `UserInfo` are required.

Please see xref:security-openid-connect.adoc#token-introspection-userinfo-cache[Token Introspection and UserInfo cache] for more information about using a default token cache or registering a custom cache implementation.

[[jwt-claim-verification]]
=== JSON Web Token Claim Verification

Please see xref:security-openid-connect.adoc#jwt-claim-verification[JSON Web Token Claim verification] section about the claim verification, including the `iss` (issuer) claim.
It applies to ID tokens but also to access tokens in a JWT format if the `web-app` application has requested the access token verification.

=== Redirection

When the user is redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to authenticate, the redirect URL includes a `redirect_uri` query parameter which indicates to the Provider where the user has to be redirected to once the authentication has been completed.

Quarkus will set this parameter to the current request URL by default. For example, if the user is trying to access a Quarkus service endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/service/1` then the `redirect_uri` parameter will be set to `http://localhost:8080/service/1`. Similarly, if the request URL is `http://localhost:8080/service/2` then the `redirect_uri` parameter will be set to `http://localhost:8080/service/2`, etc.

OpenID Connect Providers may be configured to require the `redirect_uri` parameter to have the same value (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/service/callback`) for all the redirect URLs.
In such cases a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path` property has to be set, for example, `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/service/callback`, and Quarkus will set the `redirect_uri` parameter to an absolute URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/callback` which will be the same regardless of the current request URL.

If `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path` is set but the original request URL has to be restored after the user has been redirected back to a callback URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/callback` then a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect` property has to be set to `true` which will restore the request URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/1`, etc.

[[oidc-cookies]]
=== Dealing with Cookies

The OIDC adapter uses cookies to keep the session, code flow and post logout state.

`quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` property is used to ensure the cookies are visible especially when you access the protected resources with overlapping or different roots, for example:

* `/index.html` and `/web-app/service`
* `/web-app/service1` and `/web-app/service2`
* `/web-app1/service` and `/web-app2/service`

`quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` is set to `/` by default but can be narrowed to the more specific root path such as `/web-app`.

You can also set a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header` property if the cookie path needs to be set dynamically.
For example, setting `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix` means that the value of HTTP `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header will be used to set a cookie path.

If `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header` is set but no configured HTTP header is available in the current request then the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` will be checked.

If your application is deployed across multiple domains, make sure to set a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-domain` property for the session cookie be visible to all protected Quarkus services, for example, if you have 2 services deployed at:

* https://whatever.wherever.company.net/
* https://another.address.company.net/

then the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-domain` property must be set to `company.net`.

=== Logout

By default, the logout is based on the expiration time of the ID Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider. When the ID Token expires, the current user session at the Quarkus endpoint is invalidated and the user is redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider again to authenticate. If the session at the OpenID Connect Provider is still active, users are automatically re-authenticated without having to provide their credentials again.

The current user session may be automatically extended by enabling a `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-expired` property. If it is set to `true` then when the current ID Token expires a Refresh Token Grant will be used to refresh ID Token as well as Access and Refresh Tokens.

[[user-initiated-logout]]
==== User-Initiated Logout

Users can request a logout by sending a request to the Quarkus endpoint logout path set with a `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` property.
For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` is set to "/logout" then the logout request has to be sent to `https://application.com/webapp/logout`.

This logout request will start an https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-Initiated Logout] and the user will be redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to logout where a user may be asked to confirm the logout is indeed intended.

The user will be returned to the endpoint post logout page once the logout has been completed if the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` property is set. For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set to "/signin" then the user will be returned to `https://application.com/webapp/signin` (note this URI must be registered as a valid `post_logout_redirect_uri` in the OpenID Connect Provider).

If the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set then a `q_post_logout` cookie will be created and a matching `state` query parameter will be added to the logout redirect URI and the OpenID Connect Provider will return this `state` once the logout has been completed. It is recommended for the Quarkus `web-app` applications to check that a `state` query parameter matches the value of the `q_post_logout` cookie which can be done for example in a JAX-RS filter.

Note that a cookie name will vary when using xref:security-openid-connect-multitenancy.adoc[OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy]. For example, it will be named `q_post_logout_tenant_1` for a tenant with a `tenant_1` id, etc.

Here is an example of how to configure an RP initiated logout flow:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app

quarkus.oidc.logout.path=/logout
quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path=/welcome.html

# Only the authenticated users can initiate a logout:
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/logout
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated

# Logged-out users should be returned to the /welcome.html site which will offer an option to re-login:
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/welcome.html
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=permit
----

You may also need to set `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` to a path value common to all the application resources which is `/` in this example.
See <<oidc-cookies, Dealing with Cookies>> for more information.

Note that some OpenID Connect providers do not support https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-Initiated Logout] specification (possibly because it is still technically a draft) and do not return an OpenID Connect well-known `end_session_endpoint` metadata property. However, it should not be a problem since these providers' specific logout mechanisms may only differ in how the logout URL query parameters are named.

According to the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-Initiated Logout] specification, the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` property is represented as a `post_logout_redirect_uri` query parameter which will not be recognized by the providers which do not support this specification.

You can use `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-url-param` to work around this issue. You can also request more logout query parameters added with `quarkus.oidc.logout.extra-params`. For example, here is how you can support a logout with `Auth0`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://dev-xxx.us.auth0.com
quarkus.oidc.client-id=redacted
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=redacted
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app

quarkus.oidc.tenant-logout.logout.path=/logout
quarkus.oidc.tenant-logout.logout.post-logout-path=/welcome.html

# Auth0 does not return the `end_session_endpoint` metadata property, configure it instead
quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=v2/logout
# Auth0 will not recognize the 'post_logout_redirect_uri' query parameter so make sure it is named as 'returnTo'
quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-uri-param=returnTo

# Set more properties if needed.
# For example, if 'client_id' is provided then a valid logout URI should be set as Auth0 Application property, without it - as Auth0 Tenant property.
quarkus.oidc.logout.extra-params.client_id=${quarkus.oidc.client-id}
----

[[back-channel-logout]]
==== Back-Channel Logout

link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html[Back-Channel Logout] is used by OpenID Connect providers to log out the current user from all the applications this user is currently logged in, bypassing the user agent.

You can configure Quarkus to support `Back-Channel Logout` as follows:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app

quarkus.oidc.logout.backchannel.path=/back-channel-logout
----

Absolute `Back-Channel Logout` URL is calculated by adding `quarkus.oidc.back-channel-logout.path` to the current endpoint URL, for example, `http://localhost:8080/back-channel-logout`. You will need to configure this URL in the Admin Console of your OpenID Connect Provider.

[[local-logout]]
==== Local Logout

If you work with a social provider such as Google and are concerned that the users can be logged out from all their Google applications with the <<user-initiated-logout,User-Initiated Logout>> which redirects the users to the provider's logout endpoint then you can support a local logout with the help of the <<oidc-session,OidcSession>> which only clears the local session cookie, for example:

[source,java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import io.quarkus.oidc.OidcSession;

@Path("/service")
public class ServiceResource {

    @Inject
    OidcSession oidcSession;

    @GET
    @Path("logout")
    public String logout() {
        oidcSession.logout().await().indefinitely();
        return "You are logged out".
    }
----


[[session-management]]
=== Session Management

If you have a xref:security-openid-connect.adoc#single-page-applications[Single Page Application for Service Applications] where your OpenID Connect Provider script such as `keycloak.js` is managing an authorization code flow then that script will also control the SPA authentication session lifespan.

If you work with a Quarkus OIDC `web-app` application then it is Quarkus OIDC Code Authentication mechanism which is managing the user session lifespan.

The session age is calculated by adding the lifespan value of the current IDToken and the values of the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` and `quarkus.oidc.token.lifespan-grace` properties. Of the last two properties only `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` should be used to significantly extend the session lifespan if required since `quarkus.oidc.token.lifespan-grace` is only meant for taking some small clock skews into consideration.

When the currently authenticated user returns to the protected Quarkus endpoint and the ID token associated with the session cookie has expired then, by default, the user will be auto-redirected to the OIDC Authorization endpoint to re-authenticate. Most likely the OIDC provider will challenge the user again though not necessarily if the session between the user and this OIDC provider is still active which may happen if it is configured to last longer than the ID token.

If the `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-expired` then the expired ID token (as well as the access token) will be refreshed using the refresh token returned with the authorization code grant response. This refresh token may also be recycled (refreshed) itself as part of this process. As a result the new session cookie will be created and the session will be extended.

Note, `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` can be important when dealing with expired ID tokens, when the user is not very active. In such cases, if the ID token expires, then the session cookie may not be returned to the Quarkus endpoint during the next user request and Quarkus will assume it is the first authentication request. Therefore, using `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` is important if you need to have even the expired ID tokens refreshed.

You can also complement refreshing the expired ID tokens by proactively refreshing the valid ID tokens which are about to be expired within the `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-token-time-skew` value. If, during the current user request, it is calculated that the current ID token will expire within this `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-token-time-skew` then it will be refreshed and the new session cookie will be created. This property should be set to a value which is less than the ID token lifespan; the closer it is to this lifespan value the more often the ID token will be refreshed.

You can have this process further optimized by having a simple JavaScript function periodically emulating the user activity by pinging your Quarkus endpoint thus minimizing the window during which the user may have to be re-authenticated.

Note this user session can not be extended forever - the returning user with the expired ID token will have to re-authenticate at the OIDC provider endpoint once the refresh token has expired.

[[oidc-session]]
==== OidcSession

`io.quarkus.oidc.OidcSession` is a wrapper around the current `IdToken`. It can help to perform a <<local-logout, Local Logout>>, retrieve the current session's tenant identifier and check when the session will expire. More useful methods will be added to it over time.

[[token-state-manager]]
==== TokenStateManager

OIDC `CodeAuthenticationMechanism` is using the default `io.quarkus.oidc.TokenStateManager` interface implementation to keep the ID, access and refresh tokens returned in the authorization code or refresh grant responses in a session cookie. It makes Quarkus OIDC endpoints completely stateless.

Note that some endpoints do not require the access token. An access token is only required if the endpoint needs to retrieve `UserInfo` or access the downstream service with this access token or use the roles associated with the access token (the roles in the ID token are checked by default). In such cases you can set either `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.strategy=id-refresh-token` (keep ID and refresh tokens only) or `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.strategy=id-token` (keep ID token only).

If the ID, access and refresh tokens are JWT tokens then combining all of them (if the strategy is the default `keep-all-tokens`) or only ID and refresh tokens (if the strategy is `id-refresh-token`) may produce a session cookie value larger than 4KB and the browsers may not be able to keep this cookie.
In such cases, you can use `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.split-tokens=true` to have a unique session token per each of these tokens.

Note that `TokenStateManager` will encrypt the tokens before storing them in the session cookie.
For example, here is how you configure it to split the tokens and encrypt them:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.split-tokens=true
quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.encryption-secret=eUk1p7UB3nFiXZGUXi0uph1Y9p34YhBU
----

The token encryption secret must be at least 32 characters long. If this key is not configured then either `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret` or `quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret` will be hashed to create an encryption key.

`quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.encryption-secret` should be configured if Quarkus authenticates to OpenId Connect Provider using either mTLS or `private_key_jwt` (where a private RSA or EC key is used to sign a JWT token) authentication methods, otherwise a random key will be generated which will be problematic if the Quarkus application is running in the cloud with multiple pods managing the requests.

If you need you can disable encrypting the tokens in the session cookie with `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.encryption-required=false`.

Register your own `io.quarkus.oidc.TokenStateManager' implementation as an `@ApplicationScoped` CDI bean if you need to customize the way the tokens are associated with the session cookie. For example, you may want to keep the tokens in a database and have only a database pointer stored in a session cookie. Note though that it may present some challenges in making the tokens available across multiple microservices nodes.

Here is a simple example:

[source, java]
----
package io.quarkus.oidc.test;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import io.quarkus.arc.AlternativePriority;
import io.quarkus.oidc.AuthorizationCodeTokens;
import io.quarkus.oidc.OidcTenantConfig;
import io.quarkus.oidc.TokenStateManager;
import io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.DefaultTokenStateManager;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
@AlternativePriority(1)
public class CustomTokenStateManager implements TokenStateManager {

    @Inject
    DefaultTokenStateManager tokenStateManager;

    @Override
    public Uni<String> createTokenState(RoutingContext routingContext, OidcTenantConfig oidcConfig,
            AuthorizationCodeTokens sessionContent, TokenStateManager.CreateTokenStateRequestContext requestContext) {
        return tokenStateManager.createTokenState(routingContext, oidcConfig, sessionContent, requestContext)
                .map(t -> (t + "|custom"));
    }

    @Override
    public Uni<AuthorizationCodeTokens> getTokens(RoutingContext routingContext, OidcTenantConfig oidcConfig,
            String tokenState, TokenStateManager.GetTokensRequestContext requestContext) {
        if (!tokenState.endsWith("|custom")) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }
        String defaultState = tokenState.substring(0, tokenState.length() - 7);
        return tokenStateManager.getTokens(routingContext, oidcConfig, defaultState, requestContext);
    }

    @Override
    public Uni<Void> deleteTokens(RoutingContext routingContext, OidcTenantConfig oidcConfig, String tokenState,
            TokenStateManager.DeleteTokensRequestContext requestContext) {
        if (!tokenState.endsWith("|custom")) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }
        String defaultState = tokenState.substring(0, tokenState.length() - 7);
        return tokenStateManager.deleteTokens(routingContext, oidcConfig, defaultState, requestContext);
    }
}

=== Proof Of Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636[Proof Of Key for Code Exchange] (PKCE) minimizes the risk of the authorization code interception.

While `PKCE` is of primary importance to the public OpenID Connect clients (such as the SPA scripts running in a browser), it can also provide an extra level of protection to Quarkus OIDC `web-app` applications which are confidential OpenID Connect clients capable of securely storing the client secret and using it to exchange the code for the tokens.

You can enable `PKCE` for your OIDC `web-app` endpoint with a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.pkce-required` property and a 32 characters long secret, for example:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.authentication.pkce-required=true
quarkus.oidc.authentication.pkce-secret=eUk1p7UB3nFiXZGUXi0uph1Y9p34YhBU
----

If you already have a 32 character long client secret then `quarkus.oidc.authentication.pkce-secret` does not have to be set unless you prefer to use a different secret key.

The secret key is required for encrypting a randomly generated `PKCE` `code_verifier` while the user is being redirected with the `code_challenge` query parameter to OpenID Connect Provider to authenticate. The `code_verifier` will be decrypted when the user is redirected back to Quarkus and sent to the token endpoint alongside the `code`, client secret and other parameters to complete the code exchange. The provider will fail the code exchange if a `SHA256` digest of the `code_verifier` does not match the `code_challenge` provided during the authentication request.

=== Listening to important authentication events

One can register `@ApplicationScoped` bean which will observe important OIDC authentication events. The listener will be updated when a user has logged in for the first time or re-authenticated, as well as when the session has been refreshed. More events may be reported in the future. For example:

[source, java]
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;

import io.quarkus.oidc.IdTokenCredential;
import io.quarkus.oidc.SecurityEvent;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.AuthenticationRequestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
public class SecurityEventListener {

    public void event(@Observes SecurityEvent event) {
        String tenantId = event.getSecurityIdentity().getAttribute("tenant-id");
        RoutingContext vertxContext = event.getSecurityIdentity().getCredential(IdTokenCredential.class).getRoutingContext();
        vertxContext.put("listener-message", String.format("event:%s,tenantId:%s", event.getEventType().name(), tenantId));
    }
}
----

=== Single Page Applications

Please check if implementing SPAs the way it is suggested in the xref:security-openid-connect.adoc#single-page-applications[Single Page Applications for Service Applications] section can meet your requirements.

If you prefer to use SPA and JavaScript API such as `Fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`(XHR) with Quarkus web applications, please be aware that OpenID Connect Providers may not support CORS for Authorization endpoints where the users are authenticated after a redirect from Quarkus. This will lead to authentication failures if the Quarkus application and the OpenID Connect Provider are hosted on the different HTTP domains/ports.

In such cases, set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.java-script-auto-redirect` property to `false` which will instruct Quarkus to return a `499` status code and `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `OIDC` value. The browser script also needs to be updated to set `X-Requested-With` header with the `JavaScript` value and reload the last requested page in case of `499`, for example:

[source,javascript]
----
Future<void> callQuarkusService() async {
    Map<String, String> headers = Map.fromEntries([MapEntry("X-Requested-With", "JavaScript")]);

    await http
        .get("https://localhost:443/serviceCall")
        .then((response) {
            if (response.statusCode == 499) {
                window.location.assign("https://localhost.com:443/serviceCall");
            }
         });
  }
----

=== Cross Origin Resource Sharing

If you plan to consume this application from a Single Page Application running on a different domain, you will need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Please read the xref:http-reference.adoc#cors-filter[HTTP CORS documentation] for more details.

[[oauth2]]
=== Integration with GitHub and other OAuth2 providers

Some well known providers such as GitHub or LinkedIn are not OpenID Connect but OAuth2 providers which support the `authorization code flow`, for example, link:https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps[GitHub OAuth2] and link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow[LinkedIn OAuth2].

The main difference between OpenID Connect and OAuth2 providers is that OpenID Connect providers, by building on top of OAuth2, return an `ID Token` representing a user authentication, in addition to the standard authorization code flow `access` and `refresh` tokens returned by `OAuth2` providers.

OAuth2 providers such as GitHub do not return `IdToken`, the fact of the user authentication is implicit and is indirectly represented by the `access` token which represents an authenticated user authorizing the current Quarkus `web-app` application to access some data on behalf of the authenticated user.

For example, when working with GitHub, the Quarkus endpoint can acquire an `access` token which will allow it to request a GitHub profile of the current user.
In fact this is exactly how a standard OpenID Connect `UserInfo` acquisition also works - by authenticating into your OpenID Connect provider you also give a permission to Quarkus application to acquire your <<user-info,UserInfo>> on your behalf - and it also shows what is meant by OpenID Connect being built on top of OAuth2.

In order to support the integration with such OAuth2 servers, `quarkus-oidc` needs to be configured to allow the authorization code flow responses without `IdToken`: `quarkus.oidc.authentication.id-token-required=false`.

It is required because `quarkus-oidc` expects that not only `access` and `refresh` tokens but also `IdToken` will be returned once the authorization code flow completes.

Note, even though you will configure the extension to support the authorization code flows without `IdToken`, an internal `IdToken` will be generated to support the way `quarkus-oidc` operates where an `IdToken` is used to support the authentication session and to avoid redirecting the user to the provider such as GitHub on every request. In this case the session lifespan is set to 5 minutes which can be extended further as described in the <<session-management,session management>> section.

The next step is to ensure that the returned access token can be useful to the current Quarkus endpoint.
If the OAuth2 provider supports the introspection endpoint then you may be able to use this access token as a source of roles with `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`. If no introspection endpoint is available then at the very least it should be possible to request <<user-info,UserInfo>> from this provider with `quarkus.oidc.authentication.user-info-required` - this is the case with GitHub.

Configuring the endpoint to request <<user-info,UserInfo>> is the only way `quarkus-oidc` can be integrated with the providers such as GitHub.

Note that requiring <<user-info,UserInfo>> involves making a remote call on every request - therefore you may want to consider caching `UserInfo` data, see <<token-introspection-userinfo-cache,Token Introspection and UserInfo Cache> for more details.

Alternatively, you may want to request that `UserInfo` is embedded into the internal generated `IdToken` with the `quarkus.oidc.cache-user-info-in-idtoken=true` property - the advantage of this approach is that by default no cached `UserInfo` state will be kept with the endpoint - instead it will be stored in a session cookie. You may also want to consider encrypting `IdToken` in this case if `UserInfo` contains sensitive data, please see <<token-state-manager,Encrypt Tokens With TokenStateManager>> for more information.

Also, OAuth2 servers may not support a well-known configuration endpoint in which case the discovery has to be disabled and the authorization, token, and introspection and/or userinfo endpoint paths have to be configured manually.

Here is how you can integrate `quarkus-oidc` with GitHub after you have link:https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app[created a GitHub OAuth application]. Configure your Quarkus endpoint like this:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.provider=github
quarkus.oidc.client-id=github_app_clientid
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=github_app_clientsecret

# user:email scope is requested by default, use 'quarkus.oidc.authentication.scopes' to request different scopes such as `read:user`.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps for more information.

# Consider enabling UserInfo Cache 
# quarkus.oidc.token-cache.max-size=1000
# quarkus.oidc.token-cache.time-to-live=5M
#
# Or having UserInfo cached inside IdToken itself
# quarkus.oidc.cache-user-info-in-idtoken=true
----

See xref:security-openid-connect-providers.adoc[Well Known OpenID Connect providers] for more details about configuring other well-known providers.

This is all what is needed for an endpoint like this one to return the currently authenticated user's profile with `GET http://localhost:8080/github/userinfo` and access it as the individual `UserInfo` properties:

[source,java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;

import io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/github")
@Authenticated
public class TokenResource {

    @Inject
    UserInfo userInfo;

    @GET
    @Path("/userinfo")
    @Produces("application/json")
    public String getUserInfo() {
        return userInfo.getUserInfoString();
    }
}
----

If you support more than one social provider with the help of xref:security-openid-connect-multitenancy.adoc[OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy], for example, Google which is an OpenID Connect Provider returning `IdToken` and GitHub which is an OAuth2 provider returning no `IdToken` and only allowing to access `UserInfo` then you can have your endpoint working with only the injected `SecurityIdentity` for both Google and GitHub flows. A simple augmentation of `SecurityIdentity` will be required where a principal created with the internally generated `IdToken` will be replaced with the `UserInfo` based principal when the GiHub flow is active:

[source,java]
----
package io.quarkus.it.keycloak;

import java.security.Principal;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

import io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.AuthenticationRequestContext;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentityAugmentor;
import io.quarkus.security.runtime.QuarkusSecurityIdentity;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomSecurityIdentityAugmentor implements SecurityIdentityAugmentor {

    @Override
    public Uni<SecurityIdentity> augment(SecurityIdentity identity, AuthenticationRequestContext context) {
        RoutingContext routingContext = identity.getAttribute(RoutingContext.class.getName());
        if (routingContext != null && routingContext.normalizedPath().endsWith("/github")) {
	        QuarkusSecurityIdentity.Builder builder = QuarkusSecurityIdentity.builder(identity);
	        UserInfo userInfo = identity.getAttribute("userinfo");
	        builder.setPrincipal(new Principal() {
	
	            @Override
	            public String getName() {
	                return userInfo.getString("preferred_username");
	            }
	
	        });
	        identity = builder.build();
        }
        return Uni.createFrom().item(identity);
    }

}
----

Now, the following code will work when the user is signing in into your application with both Google or GitHub:
 
[source,java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;

@Path("/service")
@Authenticated
public class TokenResource {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity identity;

    @GET
    @Path("/google")
    @Produces("application/json")
    public String getUserName() {
        return identity.getPrincipal().getName();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/github")
    @Produces("application/json")
    public String getUserName() {
        return identity.getPrincipal().getUserName();
    }
}
----

Possibly a simpler alternative is to inject both `@IdToken JsonWebToken` and `UserInfo` and use `JsonWebToken` when dealing with the providers returning `IdToken` and `UserInfo` - with the providers which do not return `IdToken`.

The last important point is to make sure the callback path you enter in the GitHub OAuth application configuration matches the endpoint path where you'd like the user be redirected to after a successful GitHub authentication and application authorization, in this case it has to be set to `http:localhost:8080/github/userinfo`.

=== Cloud Services

==== Google Cloud

You can have Quarkus OIDC `web-app` applications access **Google Cloud services** such as **BigQuery** on behalf of the currently authenticated users who have enabled OpenID Connect (Authorization Code Flow) permissions to such services in their Google Developer Consoles.

It is super easy to do with https://github.com/quarkiverse[Quarkiverse] https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-google-cloud-services[Google Cloud Services], only add
the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-google-cloud-services/releases/latest[latest tag] service dependency, for example:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.googlecloudservices</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-google-cloud-bigquery</artifactId>
    <version>${quarkiverse.googlecloudservices.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkiverse.googlecloudservices:quarkus-google-cloud-bigquery:${quarkiverse.googlecloudservices.version}")
----

and configure Google OIDC properties:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.provider=google
quarkus.oidc.client-id={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret={GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}
quarkus.oidc.token.issuer=https://accounts.google.com
----

=== Provider Endpoint configuration

OIDC `web-app` application needs to know OpenID Connect provider's authorization, token, `JsonWebKey` (JWK) set and possibly `UserInfo`, introspection and end session (RP-initiated logout) endpoint addresses.

By default, they are discovered by adding a `/.well-known/openid-configuration` path to the configured `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url`.

Alternatively, if the discovery endpoint is not available, or if you would like to save on the discovery endpoint round-trip, you can disable the discovery and configure them with relative path values, for example:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.discovery-enabled=false
# Authorization endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/auth
quarkus.oidc.authorization-path=/protocol/openid-connect/auth
# Token endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token
quarkus.oidc.token-path=/protocol/openid-connect/token
# JWK set endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/certs
quarkus.oidc.jwks-path=/protocol/openid-connect/certs
# UserInfo endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
quarkus.oidc.user-info-path=/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
# Token Introspection endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
quarkus.oidc.introspection-path=/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
# End session endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/logout
quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=/protocol/openid-connect/logout
----

Sometimes your OpenId Connect provider supports a metadata discovery but does not return all the endpoint URLs required for the authorization code flow to complete or for the application to support the additional functions such as a user logout. In such cases you can simply configure a missing endpoint URL locally:

[source, properties]
----
# Metadata is auto-discovered but it does not return an end-session endpoint URL

quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/oidcprovider/account

# Configure the end-session URL locally, it can be an absolute or relative (to 'quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url') address
quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=logout
----

Exactly the same configuration can be used to override a discovered endpoint URL if that URL does not work for the local Quarkus endpoint and a more specific value is required. For example, one can imagine that in the above example, a provider which supports both global and application specific end-session endpoints returns a global end-session URL such as `http://localhost:8180/oidcprovider/account/global-logout` which will logout the user from all the applications this user is currently logged in, while the current application only wants to get this user logged out from this application, therefore, `quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=logout` is used to override the global end-session URL.

=== Token Propagation
Please see xref:security-openid-connect-client-reference.adoc#token-propagation[Token Propagation] section about the Authorization Code Flow access token propagation to the downstream services.

[[oidc-provider-client-authentication]]
=== Oidc Provider Client Authentication

`quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProviderClient` is used when a remote request to an OpenID Connect Provider has to be done. It has to authenticate to the OpenID Connect Provider when the authorization code has to be exchanged for the ID, access and refresh tokens, when the ID and access tokens have to be refreshed or introspected.

All the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication[OIDC Client Authentication] options are supported, for example:

`client_secret_basic`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=mysecret
----

or

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.value=mysecret
----

or with the secret retrieved from a xref:credentials-provider.adoc[CredentialsProvider]:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app

# This is a key which will be used to retrieve a secret from the map of credentials returned from CredentialsProvider
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.provider.key=mysecret-key
# Set it only if more than one CredentialsProvider can be registered
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.provider.name=oidc-credentials-provider
----

`client_secret_post`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.value=mysecret
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.method=post
----

`client_secret_jwt`, signature algorithm is HS256:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret=AyM1SysPpbyDfgZld3umj1qzKObwVMkoqQ-EstJQLr_T-1qS0gZH75aKtMN3Yj0iPS4hcgUuTwjAzZr1Z9CAow
----

or with the secret retrieved from a xref:credentials-provider.adoc[CredentialsProvider]:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app

# This is a key which will be used to retrieve a secret from the map of credentials returned from CredentialsProvider
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret-provider.key=mysecret-key
# Set it only if more than one CredentialsProvider can be registered
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret-provider.name=oidc-credentials-provider
----

`private_key_jwt` with the PEM key file, signature algorithm is RS256:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-file=privateKey.pem
----

`private_key_jwt` with the key store file, signature algorithm is RS256:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-store-file=keystore.jks
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-store-password=mypassword
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-password=mykeypassword

# Private key alias inside the keystore
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-id=mykeyAlias
----

Using `client_secret_jwt` or `private_key_jwt` authentication methods ensures that no client secret goes over the wire.

==== Additional JWT Authentication options

If `client_secret_jwt`, `private_key_jwt` authentication methods are used or an Apple `post_jwt` method is used then the JWT signature algorithm, key identifier, audience, subject and issuer can be customized, for example:

[source,properties]
----
# private_key_jwt client authentication

quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-file=privateKey.pem

# This is a token key identifier 'kid' header - set it if your OpenID Connect provider requires it.
# Note if the key is represented in a JSON Web Key (JWK) format with a `kid` property then
# using 'quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.token-key-id' is not necessary.
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.token-key-id=mykey

# Use RS512 signature algorithm instead of the default RS256
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.signature-algorithm=RS512

# The token endpoint URL is the default audience value, use the base address URL instead:
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.audience=${quarkus.oidc-client.auth-server-url}

# custom subject instead of the client id :
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.subject=custom-subject

# custom issuer instead of the client id :
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.issuer=custom-issuer
----

==== Apple POST JWT

Apple OpenID Connect Provider uses a `client_secret_post` method where a secret is a JWT produced with a `private_key_jwt` authentication method but with Apple account specific issuer and subject claims.

`quarkus-oidc` supports a non-standard `client_secret_post_jwt` authentication method which can be configured as follows:

[source,properties]
----
# Apple provider configuration sets a 'client_secret_post_jwt' authentication method
quarkus.oidc.provider=apple

quarkus.oidc.client-id=${apple.client-id}
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-file=ecPrivateKey.pem
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.token-key-id=${apple.key-id}
# Apple provider configuration sets ES256 signature algorithm

quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.subject=${apple.subject}
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.issuer=${apple.issuer}
----

==== Mutual TLS

Some OpenID Connect Providers may require that a client is authenticated as part of the `Mutual TLS` (`mTLS`) authentication process.

`quarkus-oidc` can be configured as follows to support `mTLS`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.tls.verification=certificate-validation

# Keystore configuration
quarkus.oidc.tls.key-store-file=client-keystore.jks
quarkus.oidc.tls.key-store-password=${key-store-password}

# Add more keystore properties if needed:
#quarkus.oidc.tls.key-store-alias=keyAlias
#quarkus.oidc.tls.key-store-alias-password=keyAliasPassword

# Truststore configuration
quarkus.oidc.tls.trust-store-file=client-truststore.jks
quarkus.oidc.tls.trust-store-password=${trust-store-password}
# Add more truststore properties if needed:
#quarkus.oidc.tls.trust-store-alias=certAlias
----

=== Introspection Endpoint Authentication

Some OpenID Connect Providers may require authenticating to its introspection endpoint using Basic Authentication with the credentials different to `client_id` and `client_secret` which may have already been configured to support `client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post` client authentication methods described in the <<oidc-provider-client-authentication, Oidc Provider Client Authentication>> section.

If the tokens have to be introspected and the introspection endpoint specific authentication mechanism is required then you can configure `quarkus-oidc` like this:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.introspection-credentials.name=introspection-user-name
quarkus.oidc.introspection-credentials.secret=introspection-user-secret
----

[[integration-testing]]
=== Testing

Start by adding the following dependencies to your test project:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.sourceforge.htmlunit</groupId>
    <artifactId>htmlunit</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
            <artifactId>*</artifactId>
       </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-junit5</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
testImplementation("net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit")
testImplementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-junit5")
----

[[integration-testing-wiremock]]
==== Wiremock

Add the following dependency:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-test-oidc-server</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
testImplementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-test-oidc-server")
----

Prepare the REST test endpoints, set `application.properties`, for example:

[source, properties]
----
# keycloak.url is set by OidcWiremockTestResource
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-web-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
----

and finally write the test code, for example:

[source, java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.SilentCssErrorHandler;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebClient;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlForm;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlPage;

import io.quarkus.test.common.QuarkusTestResource;
import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import io.quarkus.test.oidc.server.OidcWiremockTestResource;

@QuarkusTest
@QuarkusTestResource(OidcWiremockTestResource.class)
public class CodeFlowAuthorizationTest {

    @Test
    public void testCodeFlow() throws Exception {
        try (final WebClient webClient = createWebClient()) {
            // the test REST endpoint listens on '/code-flow'
            HtmlPage page = webClient.getPage("http://localhost:8081/code-flow");

            HtmlForm form = page.getFormByName("form");
            // user 'alice' has the 'user' role
            form.getInputByName("username").type("alice");
            form.getInputByName("password").type("alice");

            page = form.getInputByValue("login").click();

            assertEquals("alice", page.getBody().asText());
        }
    }

    private WebClient createWebClient() {
        WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
        webClient.setCssErrorHandler(new SilentCssErrorHandler());
        return webClient;
    }
}
----

`OidcWiremockTestResource` recognizes `alice` and `admin` users. The user `alice` has the `user` role only by default - it can be customized with a `quarkus.test.oidc.token.user-roles` system property. The user `admin` has the `user` and `admin` roles by default - it can be customized with a `quarkus.test.oidc.token.admin-roles` system property.

Additionally, `OidcWiremockTestResource` set token issuer and audience to `https://service.example.com` which can be customized with `quarkus.test.oidc.token.issuer` and `quarkus.test.oidc.token.audience` system properties.

`OidcWiremockTestResource` can be used to emulate all OpenID Connect providers.

[[integration-testing-keycloak-devservices]]
==== Dev Services for Keycloak

Using xref:security-openid-connect-dev-services.adoc[Dev Services for Keycloak] is recommended for the integration testing against Keycloak.
`Dev Services for Keycloak` will launch and initialize a test container: it will create a `quarkus` realm, a `quarkus-app` client (`secret` secret) and add `alice` (`admin` and `user` roles) and `bob` (`user` role) users, where all of these properties can be customized.

First prepare `application.properties`. You can start with a completely empty `application.properties` as `Dev Services for Keycloak` will register `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` pointing to the running test container as well as `quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app` and `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret`.

But if you already have all the required `quarkus-oidc` properties configured then you only need to associate `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` with the `prod` profile for `Dev Services for Keycloak`to start a container, for example:

[source,properties]
----
%prod.quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
----

If a custom realm file has to be imported into Keycloak before running the tests then you can configure `Dev Services for Keycloak` as follows:

[source,properties]
----
%prod.quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.keycloak.devservices.realm-path=quarkus-realm.json
----

Finally, write a test code the same way as it is described in the <<integration-testing-wiremock, Wiremock>> section above.
The only difference is that `@QuarkusTestResource` is no longer needed:

[source, java]
----
@QuarkusTest
public class CodeFlowAuthorizationTest {
}
----

[[integration-testing-keycloak]]
==== KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager

If you need to do the integration testing against Keycloak then you are encouraged to do it with <<integration-testing-keycloak-devservices,Dev Services For Keycloak>>.
Use `KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` for your tests only if there is a good reason not to use `Dev Services for Keycloak`.

Start with adding the following dependency:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-test-keycloak-server</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
testImplementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-test-keycloak-server")
----

which provides `io.quarkus.test.keycloak.server.KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` - an implementation of `io.quarkus.test.common.QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager` which starts a Keycloak container.

And configure the Maven Surefire plugin as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <systemPropertyVariables>
            <!-- or, alternatively, configure 'keycloak.version' -->
            <keycloak.docker.image>${keycloak.docker.image}</keycloak.docker.image>
            <!--
              Disable HTTPS if required:
              <keycloak.use.https>false</keycloak.use.https>
            -->
        </systemPropertyVariables>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

(and similarly the Maven Failsafe plugin when testing in native image).

And now set the configuration and write the test code the same way as it is described in the <<integration-testing-wiremock, Wiremock>> section above.
The only difference is the name of `QuarkusTestResource`:

[source, java]
----
import io.quarkus.test.keycloak.server.KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager;

@QuarkusTest
@QuarkusTestResource(KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager.class)
public class CodeFlowAuthorizationTest {
}
----

`KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` registers `alice` and `admin` users. The user `alice` has the `user` role only by default - it can be customized with a `keycloak.token.user-roles` system property. The user `admin` has the `user` and `admin` roles by default - it can be customized with a `keycloak.token.admin-roles` system property.

By default, `KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` uses HTTPS to initialize a Keycloak instance which can be disabled with `keycloak.use.https=false`.
Default realm name is `quarkus` and client id - `quarkus-web-app` - set `keycloak.realm` and `keycloak.web-app.client` system properties to customize the values if needed.

[[integration-testing-security-annotation]]
==== TestSecurity annotation

Please see xref:security-openid-connect.adoc#integration-testing-security-annotation[Use TestingSecurity with injected JsonWebToken] section for more information about using `@TestSecurity` and `@OidcSecurity` annotations for testing the `web-app` application endpoint code which depends on the injected ID and access `JsonWebToken` as well as `UserInfo` and `OidcConfigurationMetadata`.

=== How to check the errors in the logs

Please enable `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider` `TRACE` level logging to see more details about the token verification errors:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider".level=TRACE
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider".min-level=TRACE
----

Please enable `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder` `TRACE` level logging to see more details about the OidcProvider client initialization errors:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder".level=TRACE
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder".min-level=TRACE
----

=== Running behind a reverse proxy

OIDC authentication mechanism can be affected if your Quarkus application is running behind a reverse proxy/gateway/firewall when HTTP `Host` header may be reset to the internal IP address, HTTPS connection may be terminated, etc. For example, an authorization code flow `redirect_uri` parameter may be set to the internal host instead of the expected external one.

In such cases configuring Quarkus to recognize the original headers forwarded by the proxy will be required, see xref:http-reference.adoc#reverse-proxy[Running behind a reverse proxy] Vert.x documentation section for more information.

For example, if your Quarkus endpoint runs in a cluster behind Kubernetes Ingress then a redirect from the OpenID Connect Provider back to this endpoint may not work since the calculated `redirect_uri` parameter may point to the internal endpoint address. This problem can be resolved with the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.proxy.proxy-address-forwarding=true
quarkus.http.proxy.allow-forwarded=false
quarkus.http.proxy.enable-forwarded-host=true
quarkus.http.proxy.forwarded-host-header=X-ORIGINAL-HOST
----

where `X-ORIGINAL-HOST` is set by Kubernetes Ingress to represent the external endpoint address.

`quarkus.oidc.authentication.force-redirect-https-scheme` property may also be used when the Quarkus application is running behind an SSL terminating reverse proxy.

=== External and Internal Access to OpenID Connect Provider

Note that the OpenID Connect Provider externally accessible authorization, logout and other endpoints may have different HTTP(S) URLs compared to the URLs auto-discovered or configured relative to `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` internal URL.
In such cases an issuer verification failure may be reported by the endpoint and redirects to the externally accessible Connect Provider endpoints may fail.

In such cases, if you work with Keycloak then please start it with a `KEYCLOAK_FRONTEND_URL` system property set to the externally accessible base URL.
If you work with other Openid Connect providers then please check your provider's documentation.

=== Customize authentication requests

By default, only the `response_type` (set to `code`), `scope` (set to 'openid'), `client_id`, `redirect_uri` and `state` properties are passed as HTTP query parameters to the OpenID Connect provider's authorization endpoint when the user is redirected to it to authenticate.

You can add more properties to it with `quarkus.oidc.authentication.extra-params`. For example, some OpenID Connect providers may choose to return the authorization code as part of the redirect URI's fragment which would break the authentication process - it can be fixed as follows:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.authentication.extra-params.response_mode=query
----

=== Customize authentication error response

If the user authentication has failed at the OpenID Connect Authorization endpoint, for example, due to an invalid scope or other invalid parameters included in the redirect to the provider, then the provider will redirect the user back to Quarkus not with the `code` but `error` and `error_description` parameters.

In such cases HTTP `401` will be returned by default. However, you can instead request that a custom public error endpoint is called in order to return a user-friendly HTML error page. Use `quarkus.oidc.authentication.error-path`, for example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.authentication.error-path=/error
----

It has to start from a forward slash and be relative to the current endpoint's base URI. For example, if it is set as '/error' and the current request URI is `https://localhost:8080/callback?error=invalid_scope` then a final redirect will be made to `https://localhost:8080/error?error=invalid_scope`.

It is important that this error endpoint is a public resource to avoid the user redirected to this page be authenticated again.
