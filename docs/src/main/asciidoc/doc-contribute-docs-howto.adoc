Outline the recommended steps for making successful contributions to Quarkus documentation.

== Prerequisites

Quarkus docs use AsciiDoc, a lightweight markup language.

We suggest you have the following materials nearby:

- An editor or IDE that provides syntax highlighting and previews for AsciiDoc, either natively or with a plugin.
- The https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc syntax reference]
- The xref:{doc-guides}/doc-reference.adoc[Quarkus documentation reference] for required syntax and other conventions.

== Sources

- AsciiDoc files are in the `src/main/asciidoc` directory within the `docs` module of the {quarkus-base-url}/tree/main/docs[Quarkus GitHub repository].
- Configuration documentation is generated from JavaDoc comments in Java source files.
- Java, YAML, and other source files can also be xref:doc-reference.adoc#reference-source-code[referenced] by AsciiDoc files.

== Preview and build Quarkus documentation

AsciiDoc syntax highlighting and the preview provided by an IDE may be enough for minor documentation changes.
For significant changes or updates to generated configuration documentation,
you should build the `docs` module and view resulting output before submitting your changes for review.

include::{includes}/compile-quarkus-quickly.adoc[tag=quickly-install-docs]

This will produce:

- Generated AsciiDoc (`adoc` files) describing configuration properties in the `target/asciidoc/generated/config/` directory.
- AsciiDoc output (`html` files) in the `docs/target/generated-docs/` directory.
- YAML files containing metadata for all documents individually (`docs/target/indexByFile.yaml`) and grouped by document type (`target/indexByType.yaml`). 
- YAML files that list metadata errors by file (`docs/target/errorsByFile.yaml`) and by error type (`docs/target/errorsByType.yaml`)

As you make changes, you can rebuild the `docs` module specifically to update the generated HTML:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw -f docs clean install
----

[NOTE]
====
When updating extension configuration:

. Revise the Javadoc in the extension
. Build the extension to regenerate content in `target/asciidoc/generated/config/`
. Build the `docs` module to view the rendered results.
====

== Lint documentation changes with Vale

Our builds use https://vale.sh[Vale] to check grammar, style, and word usage in the English versions of our documents.
The configuration for vale is in the `docs/.vale` directory.

NOTE: The Vale configuration file is `docs/.vale/vale.ini`.

=== Containerized Vale

This approach requires a working container runtime (Docker or xref:podman.adoc[Podman]). 

The `docs` module has a JUnit 5 test that will run the Vale linter in a container (using https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers]). 
It verifies both Quarkus document metadata and Vale style rules. 

Run the test in one of the following ways:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw -f docs test -Dvale -DvaleLevel=suggestion # <1>
./mvnw -f docs test -Dvale=git -DvaleLevel=warning # <2>
./mvnw -f docs test -Dvale='doc-.*' -DvaleLevel=error # <3>
----
<1> Run the Vale linter for all `*.adoc` files in the `src/main/asciidoc` directory of the `docs` module.
Include suggestions, warnings, and errors in the results.
<2> Run the Vale linter for any modified `*.adoc` files in the `docs` module (`git status`).
Include warnings and errors in the results.
<3> Run the Vale linter for `*.adoc` files that match the regular expression (Java Pattern syntax).
Include errors in the results.


=== Use the Vale CLI

If you install the https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/[install the Vale CLI], you must specify the configuration file along with the directory or list of files to scan:

[source,shell]
----
vale --config=docs/.vale/vale.ini --minAlertLevel=warning docs/src/main/asciidoc
----

See the https://vale.sh/manual/[Vale CLI Manual] for details.

=== Vale IDE plugins

https://vale.sh/docs/integrations/guide/[Vale IDE integrations] rely on installation the Vale CLI.

Each has it's own configuration requirements. The Visual Studio Code IDE extension, for example, requires two workspace settings:

[source,json]
----
"vale.valeCLI.config": "/path/to/quarkus/docs/.vale/vale.ini",
"vale.valeCLI.path": "/path/to/vale"
----

== Creating pull requests for doc updates

:gh-pull-requests-fork: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork
:gh-about-forks: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks

Submit your proposed changes to the core Quarkus docs by {gh-pull-requests-fork}[creating a pull request] against the `main` branch of the Quarkus repository from your own {gh-about-forks}[repository fork].

Reviews for code and documentation have different (but overlapping) participants.
To simplify collaborative review, either isolate changes to docs in their own PRs,
or ensure that the PR has a single, focused purpose For example:

- Create a single PR that adds a configuration option for an extension and updates related materials (how-to, reference) to explain the change.
- Create a single PR for related changes to a group of documents, some examples:
correcting the usage of a term, correcting a recurring error, or moving common content into a shared file.
- If there are extensive code changes and documentation changes,
create a separate PR for the documentation changes and include the relationship in the issue description.

Pull requests that contain changes to documentation will have the `area/documentation` label added automatically.
