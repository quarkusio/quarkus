= Building Quarkus apps with Gradle

include::./attributes.adoc[]

CAUTION: Quarkus Gradle support is considered preview.
You can use Gradle to create Quarkus projects as outlined in our guides. If you go beyond there will be cases where
the Gradle tasks https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/5101[does not behave as expected].
This is just a caution, and we recommend if you like Gradle you try it out and give us feedback.

[[project-creation]]
== Creating a new project

The easiest way to scaffold a Gradle project, is currently to use the Quarkus Maven plugin like so:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=my-groupId \
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-artifactId \
    -DprojectVersion=my-version \
    -DclassName="org.my.group.MyResource" \
    -Dextensions="resteasy-jsonb" \
    -DbuildTool=gradle
----

NOTE: If you just launch `mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create` the Maven plugin asks
for user inputs. You can disable (and use default values) this interactive mode by passing `-B` to the Maven command.

The following table lists the attributes you can pass to the `create` command:

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Attribute
| Default Value
| Description

| `projectGroupId`
| `org.acme.sample`
| The group id of the created project

| `projectArtifactId`
| _mandatory_
| The artifact id of the created project. Not passing it triggers the interactive mode.

| `projectVersion`
| `1.0-SNAPSHOT`
| The version of the created project

| `className`
| _Not created if omitted_
| The fully qualified name of the generated resource

| `path`
| `/hello`
| The resource path, only relevant if `className` is set.

| `extensions`
| _[]_
| The list of extensions to add to the project (comma-separated)

|===

If you decide to generate a REST resource (using the `className` attribute), the endpoint is exposed at: `http://localhost:8080/$path`.
If you use the default `path`, the URL is: http://localhost:8080/hello.

The project is either generated in the current directory or in a directory named after the passed artifactId.
If the current directory is empty, the project is generated in-place.

A pair of Dockerfiles for native and jvm mode are also generated in `src/main/docker`.
Instructions to build the image and run the container are written in those Dockerfiles.

[[custom-test-configuration-profile]]
=== Custom test configuration profile in JVM mode

By default, Quarkus tests in JVM mode are run using the `test` configuration profile. If you are not familiar with Quarkus
configuration profiles, everything you need to know is explained in the
link:config#configuration-profiles[Configuration Profiles Documentation].

It is however possible to use a custom configuration profile for your tests with the Gradle build configuration shown below.
This can be useful if you need for example to run some tests using a specific database which is not your default testing
database.

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
test {
    systemProperty "quarkus.test.profile", "foo" <1>
}
----

or, if you use the Gradle Kotlin DSL:

[source,kotlin,subs=attributes+]
----
tasks.test {
    systemProperty("quarkus.test.profile", "foo") <1>
 }
----

<1> The `foo` configuration profile will be used to run the tests.

[WARNING]
====
It is not possible to use a custom test configuration profile in native mode for now. Native tests are always run using the
`prod` profile.
====

== Dealing with extensions

From inside a Quarkus project, you can obtain a list of the available extensions with:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew listExtensions
----

You can enable an extension using:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew addExtension --extensions="hibernate-validator"
----

Extensions are passed using a comma-separated list.

The extension name is the GAV name of the extension: e.g. `io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal`.
But you can pass a partial name and Quarkus will do its best to find the right extension.
For example, `agroal`, `Agroal` or `agro`  will expand to `io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal`.
If no extension is found or if more than one extensions match, you will see a red check mark  ❌ in the command result.

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew addExtension --extensions="jdbc,agroal,non-exist-ent"
[...]
❌ Multiple extensions matching 'jdbc'
     * io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-h2
     * io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-mariadb
     * io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-postgresql
     Be more specific e.g using the exact name or the full gav.
✅ Adding extension io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal
❌ Cannot find a dependency matching 'non-exist-ent', maybe a typo?
[...]
----

You can install all extensions wich match a globbing pattern :

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew addExtension --extensions="hibernate*"
----

== Development mode

Quarkus comes with a built-in development mode.
Run your application with:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew quarkusDev
----

You can then update the application sources, resources and configurations.
The changes are automatically reflected in your running application.
This is great to do development spanning UI and database as you see changes reflected immediately.

`quarkusDev` enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means that when you modify
your Java files or your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect.
This works too for resource files like the configuration property file.
The act of refreshing the browser triggers a scan of the workspace, and if any changes are detected the
Java files are compiled, and the application is redeployed, then your request is serviced by the
redeployed application. If there are any issues with compilation or deployment an error page will let you know.

Hit `CTRL+C` to stop the application.

You can change the working directory the development environment runs on:

----
quarkusDev {
    workingDir = rootProject.projectDir
}
----

== Debugging

In development mode, Quarkus starts by default with debug mode enabled, listening to port `5005` without suspending the JVM.

This behavior can be changed by giving the `debug` system property one of the following values:

* `false` - the JVM will start with debug mode disabled
* `true` - The JVM is started in debug mode and will be listening on port `5005`
* `client` - the JVM will start in client mode and attempt to connect to `localhost:5005`
* `{port}` - The JVM is started in debug mode and will be listening on `{port}`

An additional system property `suspend` can be used to suspend the JVM, when launched in debug mode. `suspend` supports the following values:

* `y` or `true` - The debug mode JVM launch is suspended
* `n` or `false` - The debug mode JVM is started without suspending

[TIP]
====
You can also run a Quarkus application in debug mode with a suspended JVM using `./gradlew quarkusDev -Dsuspend -Ddebug` which is a shorthand for `./gradlew quarkusDev -Dsuspend=true -Ddebug=true`.

Then, attach your debugger to `localhost:5005`.
====

== Import in your IDE

Once you have a <<project-creation, project generated>>, you can import it in your favorite IDE.
The only requirement is the ability to import a Gradle project.

**Eclipse**

In Eclipse, click on: `File -> Import`.
In the wizard, select: `Gradle -> Existing Gradle Project`.
On the next screen, select the root location of the project.
The next screen list the found modules; select the generated project and click on `Finish`. Done!

In a separated terminal, run `./gradlew quarkusDev`, and enjoy a highly productive environment.

**IntelliJ**

In IntelliJ:

1. From inside IntelliJ select `File -> New -> Project From Existing Sources...` or, if you are on the welcome dialog, select `Import project`.
2. Select the project root
3. Select `Import project from external model` and `Gradle`
4. Next a few times (review the different options if needed)
5. On the last screen click on Finish

In a separated terminal or in the embedded terminal, run `./gradlew quarkusDev`. Enjoy!

**Apache Netbeans**

In Netbeans:

1. Select `File -> Open Project`
2. Select the project root
3. Click on `Open Project`

In a separated terminal or the embedded terminal, go to the project root and run `./gradlew quarkusDev`. Enjoy!

**Visual Studio Code**

Open the project directory in VS Code. If you have installed the Java Extension Pack (grouping a set of Java extensions), the project is loaded as a Gradle project.

== Building a native executable

Native executables make Quarkus applications ideal for containers and serverless workloads.

Make sure to have `GRAALVM_HOME` configured and pointing to GraalVM version {graalvm-version}.

Create a native executable using: `./gradlew buildNative`.
A native executable will be present in `build/`.

=== Build a container friendly executable

The native executable will be specific to your operating system.
To create an executable that will run in a container, use the following:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew buildNative
----

==== Customize the build native task

There are situations where it may be required to alter the default values of the `buildNative` task (whose implementation can be found link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/master/devtools/gradle/src/main/java/io/quarkus/gradle/tasks/QuarkusNative.java[here]).

The easiest way to supply custom configuration is via the command line. For example to use docker to build the native image, simply add the `--docker-build=true` flag like so:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew buildNative --docker-build=true
----

The produced executable will be a 64 bit Linux executable, so depending on your operating system
it may no longer be runnable.
However, it's not an issue as we are going to copy it to a Docker container.

Another way of customizing the native build image build process is to configure the task inside the Gradle build script. If for example it is required to set the `enableHttpUrlHandler`, it can be done like so:

[source,groovy]
----
buildNative {
    enableHttpUrlHandler = true
}
----

or, if you use the Gradle Kotlin DSL:

[source,kotlin,subs=attributes+]
----
tasks {
    named<QuarkusNative>("buildNative") {
        setEnableHttpUrlHandler(true)
    }
}
----


The native executable would then be produced by executing:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew buildNative
----

== Building Uber-Jars

Quarkus Gradle plugin supports the generation of Uber-Jars by specifying an `--uber-jar` argument as follows:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew quarkusBuild --uber-jar
----

When building an Uber-Jar you can specify entries that you want to exclude from the generated jar by using the `--ignored-entry` argument:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew quarkusBuild --uber-jar --ignored-entry=META-INF/file1.txt
----

The entries are relative to the root of the generated Uber-Jar. You can specify multiple entries by adding extra `--ignored-entry` arguments.

== Building with `./gradlew build`

By default, `./gradlew build` will build the native image also. To skip it, use
```
./gradlew build -x buildNative -x testNative
```
