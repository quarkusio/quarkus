= Authorization of Web Endpoints
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: security,web

Quarkus has an integrated pluggable web security layer. If security is enabled, all HTTP requests will have a permission check performed to make sure they are allowed to continue.
This means you cannot use `@PermitAll` to open a path if the path is blocked by the `quarkus.http.auth.` configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using JAX-RS, consider using `quarkus.security.jaxrs.deny-unannotated-endpoints` or `quarkus.security.jaxrs.default-roles-allowed` to set default security requirements instead of HTTP path-level matching because annotations can override these properties on an individual endpoint.
====

Authorization is based on user roles that the security provider provides.
To customize these roles, a `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` can be created, see
xref:security-customization.adoc#security-identity-customization[Security Identity Customization].

== Authorization using configuration

Permissions are defined in the Quarkus configuration using permission sets, with each permission set specifying a policy for access control.

.{project-name} policies summary
|===
s| Built-in policy s| Description
s| `deny` | This policy denies all users.
s| `permit` | This policy permits all users.
s| `authenticated` | This policy permits only authenticated users.
|===

You can define role-based policies that allow users with specified roles to access the resources.

.Example of a role-based policy
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.policy.role-policy1.roles-allowed=user,admin                  <1>
----
<1> This defines a role-based policy that allows users with the `user` and `admin` roles.
Such a custom policy can be referenced by permission sets just like the built-in ones, as shown in the example below.

Permission sets are defined in `application.properties` as follows:

.Example of policy configuration
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=/public/*                            <1>
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.policy=permit
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.methods=GET

quarkus.http.auth.permission.deny1.paths=/forbidden                             <2>
quarkus.http.auth.permission.deny1.policy=deny

quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.paths=/roles-secured/*,/other/*,/api/*      <3>
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.policy=role-policy1
----
<1> This permission references the default `permit` built-in policy to allow `GET` methods to `/public`.
In this case, the demonstrated setting would not affect this example because this request is allowed anyway.
<2> This permission references the built-in `deny` policy for `/forbidden`.
This is an exact path match as it does not end with `*`.
<3> This is a permission set that references the previously defined policy.
`roles1` is an example name; you can call the permission sets whatever you want.


=== Matching on paths, methods

Permission sets can also specify paths and methods as a comma-separated list.
If a path ends with the `*` wildcard, the query it generates matches all sub-paths.
Otherwise, it queries for an exact match and will only match that specific path:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=/public/*,/css/*,/js/*,/robots.txt
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.policy=permit
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.methods=GET,HEAD
----

=== Matching a path but not a method

The request is rejected if a request matches one or more permission sets based on the path but does not match any due to method requirements.

TIP: Given the above permission set, `GET /public/foo` would match both the path and method and thus be allowed,
whereas `POST /public/foo` would match the path but not the method and would therefore be rejected.

=== Matching multiple paths: longest path wins

Matching is always done on the "longest path wins" basis.
Less specific permission sets are not considered if a more specific one has been matched:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=/public/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.policy=permit
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.methods=GET,HEAD

quarkus.http.auth.permission.deny1.paths=/public/forbidden-folder/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.deny1.policy=deny
----

TIP: Given the above permission set, `GET /public/forbidden-folder/foo` would match both permission sets' paths,
but because it matches the `deny1` permission set's path on a longer match, `deny1` will be chosen, and the request will
be rejected.

[NOTE]
====
Subpath permissions always win against the root path permissions, as explained above in the `deny1` versus `permit1` permission example.
Here is another example showing subpath permission allowing a public resource access with the root path permission requiring the authorization:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.policy.user-policy.roles-allowed=user
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles.paths=/api/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles.policy=user-policy

quarkus.http.auth.permission.public.paths=/api/noauth/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.public.policy=permit
----
====

=== Matching multiple paths: most specific method wins

When a path is registered with multiple permission sets,
the permission sets that explicitly specify an HTTP method that matches the request will take precedence.
In this instance, the permission sets without methods will only come into effect if the request method does not match permission sets with the method specification.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=/public/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.policy=permit
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.methods=GET,HEAD

quarkus.http.auth.permission.deny1.paths=/public/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.deny1.policy=deny
----

[NOTE]
====
Given the above permission set, `GET /public/foo` would match the paths of both permission sets, but because it fits the explicit method of the `permit1` permission set, `permit1` is chosen, and the request is accepted.

`PUT /public/foo`, on the other hand, will not match the method permissions of `permit1`, so `deny1` will be activated and reject the request.
====

=== Matching multiple paths and methods: both win

Sometimes, the previously described rules allow multiple permission sets to win at the same time.
In that case, for the request to proceed, all the permissions must allow access.
Note that for this to happen, both have to either have specified the method or have no method. Method-specific matches take precedence.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.policy.user-policy1.roles-allowed=user
quarkus.http.auth.policy.admin-policy1.roles-allowed=admin

quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.paths=/api/*,/restricted/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.policy=user-policy1

quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles2.paths=/api/*,/admin/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles2.policy=admin-policy1
----

TIP: Given the above permission set, `GET /api/foo` would match both permission sets' paths, requiring both the `user` and `admin` roles.

=== Configuration Properties to Deny access

The following configuration settings alter the RBAC Deny behavior:

`quarkus.security.jaxrs.deny-unannotated-endpoints=true|false`::
If set to true, the access will be denied for all JAX-RS endpoints by default, so if a JAX-RS endpoint does not have any security annotations, it will default to the `@DenyAll` behavior.
This is useful to ensure you cannot accidentally expose an endpoint that is supposed to be secured.
Defaults to `false`.

`quarkus.security.jaxrs.default-roles-allowed=role1,role2`::
Defines the default role requirements for unannotated endpoints.
The `**`  role is a special role that means any authenticated user.
This cannot be combined with `deny-unannotated-endpoints`, as `deny` takes the effect instead.

`quarkus.security.deny-unannotated-members=true|false`::
- if set to true, the access will be denied to all CDI methods
and JAX-RS endpoints that do not have security annotations but are defined in classes that contain methods with
security annotations.
Defaults to `false`.

=== Disabling permissions

Permissions can be disabled at build time with an `enabled` property for each declared permission, such as:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.enabled=false
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=/public/*,/css/*,/js/*,/robots.txt
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.policy=permit
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.methods=GET,HEAD
----

Permissions can be reenabled at runtime with a system property or environment variable, such as:
`-Dquarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.enabled=true`.

=== Permission paths and HTTP root path

The `quarkus.http.root-path` configuration property is used to change the xref:http-reference.adoc#context-path[http endpoint context path].

By default, `quarkus.http.root-path` is prepended automatically to configured permission paths then do not use a forward slash, for example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=public/*,css/*,js/*,robots.txt
----

This configuration is equivalent to the following:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=${quarkus.http.root-path}/public/*,${quarkus.http.root-path}/css/*,${quarkus.http.root-path}/js/*,${quarkus.http.root-path}/robots.txt
----

A leading slash will change how the configured permission path is interpreted.
The configured URL will be used as-is, and paths will not be adjusted if the value of `quarkus.http.root-path` is changed.
For example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.permit1.paths=/public/*,css/*,js/*,robots.txt
----

This configuration will only impact resources served from the fixed/static URL `/public`, which may not match your application resources if `quarkus.http.root-path` has been set to something other than `/`.

[#standard-security-annotations]
== Authorization using annotations

{project-name} comes with built-in security to allow for Role-Based Access Control (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[RBAC])
based on the common security annotations `@RolesAllowed`, `@DenyAll`, `@PermitAll` on REST endpoints and CDI beans.

.{project-name} annotation types summary
|===
s| Annotation type s| Description
s| @DenyAll | Specifies that no security roles are allowed to invoke the specified methods.
s| @PermitAll | Specifies that all security roles are allowed to invoke the specified methods.

`@PermitAll` lets everybody in even without authentication.
s| @RolesAllowed | Specifies the list of security roles permitted to access methods in an application.

As an equivalent to `@RolesAllowed("**")`, {project-name} also provides the `io.quarkus.security.Authenticated` annotation that permits any authenticated user to access the resource.
|===

<<subject-example>> featured in this chapter demonstrates an endpoint that uses both JAX-RS and Common Security annotations to describe and secure its endpoints.

[#subject-example]
.SubjectExposingResource Example
[source,java]
----
import java.security.Principal;

import javax.annotation.security.DenyAll;
import javax.annotation.security.PermitAll;
import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;

@Path("subject")
public class SubjectExposingResource {

    @GET
    @Path("secured")
    @RolesAllowed("Tester") <1>
    public String getSubjectSecured(@Context SecurityContext sec) {
        Principal user = sec.getUserPrincipal(); <2>
        String name = user != null ? user.getName() : "anonymous";
        return name;
    }

    @GET
    @Path("unsecured")
    @PermitAll <3>
    public String getSubjectUnsecured(@Context SecurityContext sec) {
        Principal user = sec.getUserPrincipal(); <4>
        String name = user != null ? user.getName() : "anonymous";
        return name;
    }

    @GET
    @Path("denied")
    @DenyAll <5>
    public String getSubjectDenied(@Context SecurityContext sec) {
        Principal user = sec.getUserPrincipal();
        String name = user != null ? user.getName() : "anonymous";
        return name;
    }
}
----
<1> The `/subject/secured` endpoint requires an authenticated user with the granted "Tester" role through the use of the `@RolesAllowed("Tester")` annotation.
<2> The endpoint obtains the user principal from the JAX-RS `SecurityContext`. This will be non-null for a secured endpoint.
<3> The `/subject/unsecured` endpoint allows for unauthenticated access by specifying the `@PermitAll` annotation.
<4> The call to obtain the user principal returns null if the caller is unauthenticated and non-null if the caller is authenticated.
<5> The `/subject/denied` endpoint declares the `@DenyAll` annotation, thus disallowing all direct access to it as a REST method, regardless of the user calling it. The method is still invokable internally by other methods in this class.

CAUTION: Please refer to the xref:security-built-in-authentication-support-concept.adoc#proactive-authentication[Proactive Authentication] section of the Built-In Authentication Support guide if you plan to use standard security annotations on the IO thread.

The `@RolesAllowed` annotation value supports <<config-reference#property-expressions,Property Expressions>> including default values and nested Property Expressions.
Configuration properties used with the annotation are resolved at runtime.

.Annotation value examples
|===
s| Annotation s| Value explanation
s| `@RolesAllowed("${admin-role}")` | The endpoint will allow users with the role denoted by the value of the `admin-role` property.
s| `@RolesAllowed("${tester.group}-${tester.role}")` | An example showing that the value can contain multiple variables.

s| `@RolesAllowed("${customer:User}")` | A default value demonstration.
The required role will be denoted by the value of the `customer` property, but if that property is not specified, a role named `User` will be required as a default.
|===

<1> The `@RolesAllowed` annotation value is set to the value of `Administrator`.
<2> This `/subject/software-tester` endpoint requires an authenticated user that has been granted the role "Software-Tester".
It is possible to use multiple expressions in the role definition.
<3> This `/subject/user` endpoint requires an authenticated user that has been granted the role "User" through the use of the `@RolesAllowed("${customer:User}")` annotation, as we did not set the configuration property `customer`.
<4> This `/subject/secured` endpoint requires an authenticated user that has been granted the role `User` in production but allows any authenticated user in development mode.
