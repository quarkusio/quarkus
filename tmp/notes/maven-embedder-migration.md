# Maven Embedder API Migration

## Summary
Successfully migrated NxMavenBatchExecutor from Maven Invoker API to Maven Embedder API for better control over Maven execution.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies (pom.xml)
- Replaced `maven-invoker` dependency with `maven-embedder`
- Added Maven Embedder supporting dependencies:
  - `maven-embedder` 
  - `aether-connector-basic`
  - `aether-transport-wagon`
  - `wagon-http`
- Removed duplicate `maven-compat` dependency

### 2. Updated Java Implementation (NxMavenBatchExecutor.java)
- Replaced Maven Invoker imports with Maven Embedder imports:
  - `MavenCli` for direct Maven execution
  - Plexus container components
  - Maven execution request classes
- Completely rewrote execution logic using `MavenCli.doMain()`
- Updated `executeMultiProjectGoalsWithEmbedder()` method to use Maven Embedder
- Removed old Invoker-based methods that were no longer needed

### 3. Key Benefits of Maven Embedder
- Direct access to Maven's core functionality
- Better control over Maven session and execution
- Preserves Maven session context for artifact sharing between goals
- More efficient than invoking external Maven processes

### 4. Execution Flow
1. Uses `MavenCli` class directly for Maven execution
2. Captures output streams for result parsing
3. Builds Maven command arguments programmatically
4. Supports multi-project execution with `-pl` option
5. Returns structured JSON results for Nx integration

### 5. Testing
- Successfully compiled with `mvn compile`
- Successfully installed with `mvn install`
- All tests pass (48 tests run, 0 failures)
- Dependencies properly copied to target/dependency

## Status
✅ Migration complete and tested
✅ Plugin compiled and installed successfully
✅ Ready for Nx batch executor usage
