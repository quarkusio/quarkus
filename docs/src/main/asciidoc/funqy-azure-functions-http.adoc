= Quarkus - Funqy HTTP Binding with Azure Functions
:extension-status: preview

include::./attributes.adoc[]

You can use link:funqy-http[Funqy HTTP] on Azure Functions.  This allows you to invoke on multiple Funqy functions
using HTTP deployed as one Azure Function.

WARNING: The Funqy HTTP + Azure Functions binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy
needs to be portable cross a lot of different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding
is very minimalistic and you will lose REST features like linking and the ability to leverage
HTTP features like cache-control and conditional GETs.  You may want to consider using Quarkus's
JAX-RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route link:azure-functions-http[support] instead.  They also work with Quarkus and Azure Functions.


include::./status-include.adoc[]

Follow the link:azure-functions-http[Azure Functions Http Guide].  It walks through using a variety of HTTP
frameworks on Azure Functions.  Including Funqy.
