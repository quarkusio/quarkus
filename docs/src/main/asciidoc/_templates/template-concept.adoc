- xref:{doc-guides}/doc-reference.adoc[Quarkus style and content guidelines]

=== Create cross-references

To create anchors for in-file and cross-file navigation, see the following detailed instructions in the Quarkus style and content guidelines.

* xref:{doc-guides}doc-contribute-docs-howto.adoc#anchors-howto[Cross-reference in-file and cross-file content by using anchors]

* xref:{doc-guides}doc-reference.adoc#cross-references[Cross-references]


== Guidelines for a good Concept doc

Explanation/Concept documents should do things that the other parts of the documentation do not.

* Make connections to other things, even to something outside the immediate topic, if that helps explain the concept.
* Provide background and context in your explanation: explain why things are so - design decisions, historical reasons, technical constraints - draw implications, mention specific examples.
* Consider alternatives, counter-examples, or multiple different approaches to the same question.

== Language tips:

- Explain: "The reason for x is because historically, y…"
- Offer judgments and even opinions where appropriate.., "W is better than z, because…"
- Provide context that helps the reader: "An x in system y is analogous to a w in system z. However…"
- Weigh up alternatives: "Some users prefer w (because z). This can be a good approach, but…"
- Unfold the machinery’s internal secrets, to help understand why something does what it does: "An x interacts with a y as follows:…"

== References

To help direct the reader to more information about the content topic, optionally add a *References* section to the end of the page and include `links` or `xrefs` to other related content resources.
