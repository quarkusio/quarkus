= {project-name} - Measuring Performance

This guide covers:

* how we measure memory usage
* how we measure startup time

All of our tests are run on the same hardware for a given batch.
It goes without saying but it's better when you say it.

== How do we measure memory usage

When measuring the footprint of a {project-name} application, we measure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_set_size[Resident Set Size (RSS)]
and not the JVM heap size which is only a small part of the overall problem.
The JVM not only allocates native memory for heap (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`) but also structures required by the jvm to run your application. Depending on the JVM implementation, the total memory allocated for an application will include, be not limited to;

 * Heap space
 * Class metadata
 * Thread stacks
 * Compiled code
 * Garbage collection

=== Native Memory Tracking

In order to view the native memory used by the JVM, you can enable the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/nmt-8.html[Native Memory Tracking] (NMT) feature in hotspot;

Enable NMT on the command line;

 -XX:NativeMemoryTracking=[off | summary | detail] <1>

<1> NOTE: this feature will add cause an approximately 5-10% performance overhead

It is then possible to use jcmd to dump a report of the native memory usage of the Hotspot JVM running your application;

 jcmd <pid> VM.native_memory [summary | detail | baseline | summary.diff | detail.diff | shutdown] [scale= KB | MB | GB]

=== Cloud Native Memory Limits

It is important to measure the whole memory to see the impact of a Cloud Native application.
It is particularly true of container environments which will kill a process based on its full RSS memory usage.

Likewise, don't fall into the trap of only measuring private memory which is what the process uses that is not shareable with other processes.
While private memory might be useful in a environment deploying many different applications (and thus sharing memory a lot),
it is very misleading in environments like Kubernetes/OpenShift.

=== Platform Specific Memory Reporting

In order to not incur the performance overhead of running with NVM enabled, we measure the total RSS of an JVM application using tools specific to each platform.

Linux::

 The linux https://linux.die.net/man/1/pmap[pmap] tool provides a report on the native memory map for a process

 pmap -x <pid>

 13150:   /data/shamrock-application -Xmx100m -Xmn70m
 Address           Kbytes     RSS   Dirty Mode  Mapping
 0000000000400000   55652   30592       0 r-x-- shamrock-application

 ...
 ---------------- ------- ------- -------
 total kB         9726508  256092  220900

Each Memory region that has been allocated for the process is listed;

- Address: Start address of virtual address space
- Kbytes:  Size (kilobytes) of virtual address space reserved for region
- RSS:     Resident set size (kilobytes).  This is the measure of how much memory space is actually being used
- Dirty:   dirty pages (both shared and private) in kilobytes
- Mode:    Access mode for memory region
- Mapping: Includes application regions and Shared Object (.so) mappings for process

The Total RSS (kB) line reports the total native memory the process is using.

Windows::
TODO
macOS::
On macOS, you can use `ps x -o pid,rss,command -p <PID>` which list the RSS for a given process in KB (1024 bytes).

[source,bash]
--
$ ps x -o pid,rss,command -p 57160

  PID    RSS COMMAND
57160 288548 /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app/Contents/jdk/Contents/Home/jre/bin/java
--

Which means IntelliJ IDEA consumes 281,8 MB of resident memory.

== How do we measure startup time

Some frameworks use aggressive lazy initialization techniques.
It is important to measure the startup time to first request to most accurately reflect how long a framework needs to start.
Otherwise, you will miss the time the framework _actually_ takes to initialize.

Here is how we measure startup time in our tests.
