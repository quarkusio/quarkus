The TLS Registry is a Quarkus extension that centralizes TLS configuration, making it easier to manage and maintain secure connections across your application.
When defining TLS configurations in a single centralized location, you can use the TLS Registry to reference these configurations from multiple components within the application, which ensures consistency and reduces the potential for configuration errors.

The TLS Registry consolidates settings and supports multiple named configurations.
Therefore, you can tailor TLS settings for different application parts.
This flexibility is particularly useful when different components require distinct security configurations.

The TLS Registry extension is automatically included in your project when you use compatible extensions, such as Quarkus REST, gRPC, SmallRye GraphQL Client
ifndef::no-reactive-routes[]
, or Reactive Routes
endif::no-reactive-routes[]
.

As a result, applications that use the TLS Registry can be ready to handle secure communications out of the box.

TLS Registry also provides automatic certificate reloading

and compatibility with various keystore formats, such as PKCS12, PEM, and JKS.

== Using the TLS registry

To configure a TLS connection, including key and truststores, use the `+quarkus.tls.*+` properties.
These properties are required for:

 * Setting up the default TLS configuration, defined directly under `+quarkus.tls.*+`
 * Creating separate, named configurations by using `+quarkus.tls.<name>.*+`.
By specifying the `+quarkus.tls.<name>.*+` properties, you can adapt the TLS settings for a specific component.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The default TLS configuration is not a fallback or global configuration.
Each named TLS configuration, or "TLS bucket," must provide its own properties.
For instance, `quarkus.tls.reload-period` will only be applied to the default TLS configuration.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
As described in detail link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/adr/0004-using-the-tls-registry-for-clients.adoc#configuring-clients-with-the-tls-registry[here], Quarkus client extensions (such as REST, GRPC, and so on) ignore properties defined in default (that is, unnamed) TLS configurations.
The `quarkus.tls.trust-all` property is the only exception.
====

=== Configuring HTTPS for a HTTP server

To ensure secure client-server communication, the client is often required to verify the server's authenticity.

* The server must use a keystore that contains its certificate and private key.
* The client needs to be configured with a truststore to validate the server's certificate.

During the TLS handshake, the server presents its certificate, which the client then validates.
This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and secures data transmission.

The following sections guide you through setting up HTTPS by using PEM or PKCS12 keystore types.
In addition, they provide information on how to use named configurations to specify and manage multiple TLS setups at once, which makes it possible for you to define distinct settings for each.

Use one of the following configuration examples based on your keystore type:

* *By using PEM files:*
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.cert=server.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.key=server.key
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled # Reject HTTP requests
----

* *By using a `p12` (PKCS12) keystore:*
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled # Reject HTTP requests
----

* *Distinguishing multiple configurations with names:*
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=https
----

=== Configuring HTTPS for a client

The following example configures a gRPC client named "hello" to use HTTPS with a truststore from the default TLS configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.path=grpc-client-truststore.jks
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.password=password

quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.plain-text=false
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.use-quarkus-grpc-client=true
----

=== Configuring mTLS

To set up mutual TLS (mTLS) in your {project-name} application, configure the server and the client by creating and managing both a keystore and a truststore for each:

* *Server keystore*: Contains the server's certificate and private key.
* *Client keystore*: Contains the client's certificate and private key.
* *Server truststore*: Stores the client's certificate for authenticating the client.
* *Client truststore*: Stores the server's certificate for authenticating the server.
+
.An example configuration for specifying keystores and truststores:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.my-server.key-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-server.key-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.my-server.trust-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-server-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-server.trust-store.p12.password=password

quarkus.tls.my-client.trust-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-client-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-client.trust-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.my-client.key-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-client-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-client.key-store.p12.password=password

quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.plain-text=false
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.tls-configuration-name=my-client
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.use-quarkus-grpc-client=true

quarkus.http.ssl.client-auth=REQUIRED # Enable mTLS
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=my-server
quarkus.grpc.server.use-separate-server=false
quarkus.grpc.server.plain-text=false
----
+
This configuration enables mTLS by ensuring that both the server and client validate each other's certificates, which provides an additional layer of security.

[[referencing-a-tls-configuration]]
== Referencing a TLS configuration

To reference an example _named_ configuration that you created by using the `quarkus.tls.<name>.*` properties as explained in <<using-the-tls-registry>>, use the `tls-configuration-name` property as shown in the following examples:

.Example configuration for the core HTTP server:
[source,properties]
----
# Reference the named configuration
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=MY_TLS_CONFIGURATION
----

.Example configuration for a gRPC client:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.tls-configuration-name=MY_TLS_CONFIGURATION
----

.Example configuration for a SmallRye GraphQL client:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.smallrye-graphql-client.my-client.tls-configuration-name=MY_TLS_CONFIGURATION
----

[NOTE]
====
When using the Typesafe GraphQL client with a certificate reloading mechanism, as described in the <<reloading-certificates>> section, it is essential to override the bean's scope to `RequestScoped` or another similar scope shorter than the application.
This is because, by default, the Typesafe client is an application-scoped bean.
Shortening the scope guarantees that new instances of the bean created after a certificate reload will be configured with the latest certificate.
Dynamic clients are `@Dependent` scoped; inject them into components with an appropriate scope.
====

=== Referencing the default truststore of SunJSSE

JDK distributions typically contain a truststore in the `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts` file.
This truststore is used as a default truststore by SunJSSE, the default implementation of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE).
SSL/TLS capabilities provided by SunJSSE are leveraged by various Java Runtime components, such as `javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection` and others.

Although Quarkus extensions typically do not honor the default truststore of SunJSSE, it is still practical to use it in some situations.
This applies when migrating from legacy technologies or running on a Linux distribution where the SunJSSE truststore is synchronized with the operating system (OS).

To simplify the use of the SunJSSE truststore, Quarkus TLS Registry provides a TLS configuration under the name `javax.net.ssl` that mimics the default behavior of SunJSSE:

* If the `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` system property is defined, its value is honored as a truststore.
* Otherwise, the paths `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/jssecacerts` and `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts` are checked, and the first existing file is used as a truststore.
* If neither condition is met, an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

The password for opening the truststore is taken from the `javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword` system property.
If this property is not set, the default password `changeit` is used.

The `javax.net.ssl` configuration can be used as a value for various `*.tls-configuration-name` properties, as shown below:

.Example configuration for a gRPC client:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.tls-configuration-name=javax.net.ssl
----

[WARNING]
====
The `javax.net.ssl` TLS configuration can be neither customized nor overridden.
====

== Configuring TLS

TLS configuration primarily involves managing keystores and truststores.
The specific setup depends on the format used, such as PEM, P12, or JKS.

The following sections outline the various properties available for configuring TLS.

=== Key stores

Key stores store private keys and certificates.
They are mainly used on the server side but can also be used on the client side when mTLS is used.

==== PEM keystores

Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) keystores are composed of a list of file pairs:

* *The certificate file* - a `.crt` or `.pem` file.
* *The private key file* - often a `.key` file.

To configure a PEM keystore:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.a.cert=server.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.a.key=server.key
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.b.cert=my-second-cert.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.b.key=my-second-key.key
----

In most cases, you only need a single pair consisting of a certificate and a private key.
Even if the certificate is part of a certificate chain, it includes only one private key that corresponds to the end-entity certificate.

When multiple pairs are configured, the selection of one of the configured pairs of certificates and private keys is based on Server Name Indication (SNI).
The client sends the name of the server to which the client is attempting to connect, and the server selects the appropriate pair of certificates and private keys.
To use this feature, ensure that xref:./tls-registry-reference.adoc#sni[SNI] is enabled on both the client and server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When configuring multiple key pairs or certificate pairs, the server executes the configured pairs in a lexicographical order of their names by default, as demonstrated with `store.pem.a` and `store.pem.b` in the previous example.
The pair with the lowest lexicographical order is executed first.
To change this, you can define the order by using the `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.order` property.
For example, `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.order=b,c,a`.

This setting is important when using SNI, because it uses the first specified pair as the default.
====

When using PEM keystore, the following formats are supported:

* PKCS#8 private key (unencrypted)
* PKCS#1 RSA private key (unencrypted)
* Encrypted PKCS#8 private key (encrypted with AES-128-CBC)

In the later case, the `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.password` or `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.<name>.password` property must be set to the password used to decrypt the private key.

.An encrypted PEM keystore configuration example:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.cert=certificate.crt
quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.key=key.key
quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.password=password
----
include::_includes/snip-note-encrypted-pem-tech-prev.adoc[]

==== PKCS12 keystores

PKCS12 keystores are single files that contain the certificate and the private key.

To configure a PKCS12 keystore:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
----

`.p12` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the keystore.

These files can include more than one certificate and private key.
If this is the case, take either of the following actions:

* Provide and configure the alias of the certificate and the private key you want to use:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.alias=my-alias
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.alias-password=my-alias-password
----

* Alternatively, use SNI to select the appropriate certificate and private key.
Note that all keys must use the same password.

==== JKS keystores

JKS keystores are single files that contain the certificate and the private key for the server or client, used to authenticate and establish secure communications in TLS/SSL connections.

[IMPORTANT]
====
JKS is an old but still widely used Java-specific format.
However, to work with this format, you must use specific, and nowadays also deprecated, Java tooling.
Thus, its use with your {project-name} application is not recommended.

Additionally, OpenShift cert-manager or Let's Encrypt does not typically provide JKS and remains PEM-only.
====

To configure a JKS keystore:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.path=server-keystore.jks
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.password=secret
----

`.jks` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the keystore.
Also, they can include more than one certificate and private key.
If this is the case:

* Provide and configure the alias of the certificate and the private key you want to use:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.path=server-keystore.jks
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.password=secret
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.alias=my-alias
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.alias-password=my-alias-password
----
+
* Alternatively, use SNI to select the appropriate certificate and private key.
Note that all keys must use the same password.

==== Provided keystores
If you need more control over the keystore used in a TLS configuration, you can provide a CDI bean implementing the `io.quarkus.tls.runtime.KeyStoreProvider` interface. Quarkus calls `KeyStoreProvider::getKeyStore` when the TLS configuration is <<startup-checks,initially created>> and any time the configuration is <<reloading-certificates,reloaded>>. The resulting keystore and options are then made available via `TlsConfiguration::getKeyStore` and `TlsConfiguration::getKeyStoreOptions`.

.Example KeyStoreProvider
[source, java]
----
import io.quarkus.tls.runtime.KeyStoreAndKeyCertOptions;
import io.quarkus.tls.runtime.KeyStoreProvider;
import io.smallrye.common.annotation.Identifier;
import io.vertx.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer;
import io.vertx.core.net.PemKeyCertOptions;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

@ApplicationScoped <1>
@Identifier("<name>") <2>
public class ExampleKeyStoreProvider implements KeyStoreProvider {

    @Inject <3>
    SecurityDatabase securityDatabase;

    @Override
    public KeyStoreAndKeyCertOptions getKeyStore(Vertx vertx) {
        try {
            var options = new PemKeyCertOptions()
                    .addCertValue(Buffer.buffer(securityDatabase.getEntityCertificate()))
                    .addKeyValue(Buffer.buffer(securityDatabase.getEntityPrivateKey()));
            var keyStore = options
                    .loadKeyStore(vertx);
            return new KeyStoreAndKeyCertOptions(keyStore, options);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The CDI bean implementing the `KeyStoreProvider` interface can be `@ApplicationScoped`, `@Singleton` or `@Dependent`.
<2> Use the `@Identifier` qualifier to indicate a named TLS configuration for which to provide keystore options. Omit the qualifier (or use `@Default` explicitly) to indicate the default TLS configuration. See <<referencing-a-tls-configuration>> for more details.
<3> Other CDI beans can be injected for runtime access to keystore material.

[[sni]]
==== SNI

Server Name Indication (SNI) is a TLS extension that makes it possible for a client to specify the host name to which it attempts to connect during the TLS handshake.
SNI enables a server to present different TLS certificates for multiple domains on a single IP address, which facilitates secure communication for virtual hosting scenarios.

To enable SNI:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.sni=true # Disabled by default
----

With SNI enabled, the client indicates the server name during the TLS handshake, which allows the server to select the appropriate certificate:

* When configuring the keystore with PEM files, multiple certificate (CRT) and key files must be provided.
CRT is a common file extension for X.509 certificate files, typically in PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) format.
These files contain the public certificate.

* When configuring the keystore with a JKS or P12 file, the server selects the appropriate certificate based on the SNI host name provided by the client during the TLS handshake.
The server matches the SNI hostname with the common name (CN) or subject alternative names (SAN) configured in the certificates stored in the keystore.
All keystore and alias passwords must be identical.

==== Credential providers

You can use a credential provider instead of passing the keystore password and alias password in the configuration.

A credential provider offers a way to retrieve the keystore and alias password.
Note that the credential provider is only used if the password or alias password is not set in the configuration.

To configure a credential provider:

[source,properties]
----
# The name of the credential bucket in the credentials provider
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.name=my-credentials

# The name of the bean providing the credential provider (optional, using the default credential provider if not set)
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.bean-name=my-credentials-provider

# The key used to retrieve the keystore password, `password` by default
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.password-key=password

# The key used to retrieve the alias password, `alias-password` by default
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.alias-password-key=alias-password
----

IMPORTANT: The credential provider can only be used with PKCS12 and JKS keystores.

=== Trust stores

Trust stores are used to store the certificates of the trusted parties.
In regular TLS, the client uses a truststore to authenticate the server.
With mutual TLS (mTLS), both the server and the client use truststores to authenticate each other.

==== PEM truststores

PEM truststores are composed of a list of `.crt` or `.pem` files.
Each of them contains a certificate.

To configure a PEM truststore:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.pem.certs=ca.crt,ca2.pem
----

==== PKCS12 truststores

PKCS12 truststores are a single file containing the certificates.
You can use the alias to select the appropriate certificate when multiple certificates are included.

To configure a PKCS12 truststore:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.path=client-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.alias=my-alias
----

`.p12` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the truststore.
However, unlike keystores, the alias does not require a password because it contains a public certificate, not a private key.

==== JKS truststores

JKS truststores are single files that contain multiple certificates.
You can use the alias to select the appropriate certificate when multiple certificates are present.
However, avoid using the JKS format, because it is less secure than PKCS12.

To configure a JKS truststore:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.path=client-truststore.jks
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.password=password
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.alias=my-alias
----

`.jks` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the truststore.
However, unlike keystores, the alias does not require a password because it contains a public certificate, not a private key.

==== Provided truststores
If you need more control over the truststore used in a TLS configuration, you can provide a CDI bean implementing the `io.quarkus.tls.runtime.TrustStoreProvider` interface. Quarkus calls `TrustStoreProvider::getTrustStore` when the TLS configuration is <<startup-checks,initially created>> and any time the configuration is <<reloading-certificates,reloaded>>. The resulting truststore and options are then made available via `TlsConfiguration::getTrustStore` and `TlsConfiguration::getTrustStoreOptions`.

.Example TrustStoreProvider
[source, java]
----
import io.quarkus.tls.runtime.TrustStoreAndTrustOptions;
import io.quarkus.tls.runtime.TrustStoreProvider;
import io.smallrye.common.annotation.Identifier;

import io.vertx.core.net.PemTrustOptions;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

@ApplicationScoped <1>
@Identifier("<name>") <2>
public class ExampleTrustStoreProvider implements TrustStoreProvider {

    @Inject <3>
    SecurityDatabase securityDatabase;

    @Override
    public TrustStoreAndTrustOptions getTrustStore(Vertx vertx) {
        try {
            var options = new PemTrustOptions()
                    .addCertValue(Buffer.buffer(securityDatabase.getTrustedRootCertificate()));
            var trustStore = options
                    .loadKeyStore(vertx);
            return new TrustStoreAndTrustOptions(trustStore, options);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The CDI bean implementing the `TrustStoreProvider` interface can be `@ApplicationScoped`, `@Singleton` or `@Dependent`.
<2> Use the `@Identifier` qualifier to indicate a named TLS configuration for which to provide truststore options. Omit the qualifier (or use `@Default` explicitly) to indicate the default TLS configuration. See <<referencing-a-tls-configuration>> for more details.
<3> Other CDI beans can be injected for runtime access to truststore material.


==== Credential providers

Instead of passing the truststore password in the configuration, you can use a credential provider.
A credential provider allows you to retrieve passwords and other credentials.
Note that the credential provider is used only if the password is not set in the configuration.

To configure a credential provider:

[source,properties]
----
# The name of the credential bucket in the credentials provider
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.name=my-credentials

# The name of the bean providing the credential provider (optional, using the default credential provider if not set)
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.bean-name=my-credentials-provider

# The key used to retrieve the truststore password, `password` by default
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.password-key=password
----

IMPORTANT: The credential provider can only be used with PKCS12 and JKS truststores.

=== Other properties

While keystores and truststores are the most important properties, there are other properties you can use to configure TLS.

NOTE: While the following examples use the _default_ configuration, you can use the _named_ configuration by prefixing the properties with the configuration's name.

==== Cipher suites

Cipher suites are a list of ciphers that you can use during the TLS handshake.
You can configure an ordered list of enabled cipher suites.
If not configured, a reasonable default is selected from the built-in ciphers.
However, when specified, your configuration precedes the default suite defined by the SSL engine in use.

To configure the cipher suites:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.cipher-suites=TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
----

==== TLS protocol versions

The TLS protocol versions are the list of protocols that can be used during the TLS handshake.
Enabled TLS protocol versions are specified as an ordered list separated by commas.
The relevant configuration property is `quarkus.tls.protocols` or `quarkus.tls.<name>.protocols` for named TLS configurations.
It defaults to `TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2` if not configured.

The available options are `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`, and `TLSv1.3`.

For example, to only enable `TLSv1.3`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.protocols=TLSv1.3
----

==== Handshake timeout

When a TLS connection is established, the handshake phase is the first step.
During this phase, the client and server exchange information to establish the connection, which typically includes the cipher suite, the TLS protocol version, and the certification validation.

To configure the timeout for the handshake phase:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.handshake-timeout=10S # Default.
----

==== ALPN

Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is a TLS extension that allows the client and server to negotiate which protocol they will use for communication during the TLS handshake.
ALPN enables more efficient communication by allowing the client to indicate its preferred application protocol to the server before establishing the TLS connection.

This helps in scenarios like HTTP/2, where multiple protocols might be available, allowing for faster protocol selection.

ALPN is enabled by default.

* To disable it:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.alpn=false
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Disabling ALPN is not recommended for non-experts, as it can lead to performance degradation, protocol negotiation issues, and unexpected behavior, particularly with protocols like HTTP/2.
However, disabling ALPN can be useful for diagnosing native inconsistencies or testing performance in specific edge cases where protocol negotiation causes conflicts.
====

==== Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of certificates that the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) revoked before their scheduled expiration date.
When a certificate is compromised, no longer needed, or deemed invalid, the CA adds it to the CRL to inform relying parties not to trust it anymore.

You can configure the CRL with the list of certificate files you no longer trust by using the DER or PKCS#7 (P7B) formats.

* For the DER format, pass DER-encoded CRLs.
* For the PKCS#7 format, pass the `SignedData` object, where the only significant field is `crls`.

To configure the CRL:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.certificate-revocation-list=ca.crl, ca2.crl
----

==== Trusting all certificates and hostname verification

You can configure your TLS connection to trust all certificates and disable the hostname verification.
Note that these are two different processes:

* Trusting all certificates ignores the certificate validation, so all certificates are trusted.
This method is useful for testing with self-signed certificates, but it should not be used in production.

* Hostname verification is the process of verifying the server's identity.

It is useful to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and often defaults to `HTTPS` or `LDAPS`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These two properties should not be used in production.
====

To trust all certificates:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-all=true
----

To disable hostname verification:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.hostname-verification-algorithm=NONE
----

[[client-renegotiation]]
==== Preventing client renegotiation

Client-initiated renegotiation allows a client to request new session parameters, such as a different cipher suite, during an established TLS connection.
While this feature can provide flexibility, it also introduces a potential security risk when using TLS 1.2.

When a client initiates a new TLS handshake, the server typically consumes significantly more CPU resources than the client. This resource asymmetry can be exploited to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, overwhelming the server with renegotiation requests.

TLS 1.3 completely removes support for renegotiation, effectively closing this potential attack vector.

* To secure TLS 1.2 and earlier, set `jdk.tls.rejectClientInitiatedRenegotiation` to `true` to prevent client-initiated renegotiation.
+
[source,bash]

If you are using the Quarkus-provided `Dockerfile` in JVM mode, you can disable renegotiation by adding the property to the `JAVA_OPTS_APPEND` environment variable:
+
[source,dockerfile]
----
ENV JAVA_OPTS_APPPEND="-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0 -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager -Djdk.tls.rejectClientInitiatedRenegotiation=true"
----


=== Configuration reference

The following table lists the supported properties:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-tls-registry.adoc[opts=optional, leveloffset=+1]

== The registry API

While extensions automatically use the TLS registry, you can also access the TLS configuration programmatically through the registry API.

To access the TLS configuration, inject the `TlsConfigurationRegistry` bean.
You can retrieve a named TLS configuration by calling `get("<NAME>")` or the default configuration by calling `getDefault()`.

[source,java]
----
 @Inject
 TlsConfigurationRegistry certificates;
// ...
TlsConfiguration def = certificates.getDefault().orElseThrow();
TlsConfiguration named = certificates.get("name").orElseThrow();
//...
----

The `TlsConfiguration` object contains the keystores, truststores, cipher suites, protocols, and other properties.
It also provides a way to create an `SSLContext` from the configuration.

You can also use the `TlsConfiguration` object to configure the Vert.x client or server, such as `KeyCertOptions`, `TrustOptions`, and so on.

== Registering a certificate from an extension

This section is only for extension developers.
An extension can register a certificate in the TLS registry.
This is useful when an extension needs to provide a certificate to the application or provides a different format.

To register a certificate in the TLS registry by using the extension, the _processor_ extension must produce a `TlsCertificateBuildItem` composed of a name and a `CertificateSupplier`.

[source,java]
----
TlsCertificateBuildItem item = new TlsCertificateBuildItem("named",
    new MyCertificateSupplier());
----

The certificate supplier is a runtime object generally retrieved by using a recorder method.

.An example of a certificate supplier:
[source,java]
----
public class MyCertificateSupplier implements Supplier<TlsConfiguration> {

        @Override
        public TlsConfiguration get() {
            try {
                KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
                ks.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("target/certs/test-registration-keystore.p12"),
                        "password".toCharArray());
                KeyStore ts = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
                ts.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("target/certs/test-registration-truststore.p12"),
                        "password".toCharArray());
                return new BaseTlsConfiguration() {
                    @Override
                    public KeyStore getKeyStore() {
                        return ks;
                    }

                    @Override
                    public KeyStore getTrustStore() {
                        return ts;
                    }
                };
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    }
----

== Startup checks

When an application that uses the TLS extension starts, the TLS registry performs several checks to ensure the configuration is correct:

* Keystores and truststores are accessible.
* Aliases are available and accessible in the keystores and truststores.
* Certificates are valid.
* Cipher suites and protocols are valid.
* Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are valid.

If any of these checks fail, the application will not start.

[[reloading-certificates]]
== Reloading certificates

The `TlsConfiguration` obtained from the `TLSConfigurationRegistry` includes a mechanism for reloading certificates.
The `reload` method refreshes the keystores, truststores, and CRLs, typically by reloading them from the file system.

NOTE: The reload operation is not automatic and must be triggered manually.
Additionally, the `TlsConfiguration` implementation must support reloading, as is the case for the configured certificate.

The `reload` method returns a `boolean` indicating whether the reload was successful.
A value of `true` means the reload operation was successful, not necessarily that there were updates to the certificates.

After a `TlsConfiguration` has been reloaded, servers and clients using this configuration may need to perform specific actions to apply the new certificates.

The preferred approach for informing clients and servers about the certificate reload is to fire a CDI event of type `io.quarkus.tls.CertificateUpdatedEvent`.
To do so, inject a CDI event of this type and fire it when a reload occurs.

.An example of manually reloading a TLS configuration and notifying components by firing a `CertificateUpdatedEvent` and reacting to it:
[source,java]
----
// in the class that performs the reload
@Inject
Event<CertificateUpdatedEvent> event;
@Inject
TlsConfigurationRegistry registry;

public void reload() {
    TlsConfiguration config = registry.get("name").orElseThrow();
    if (config.reload()) {
        event.fire(new CertificateUpdatedEvent("name", config));
    }
}

// In the server (or client) code
private final io.vertx.core.http.HttpServer server;

public void onCertificateUpdate(@Observes CertificateUpdatedEvent reload) {
    if ("name".equals(event.getName())) {
        server.updateSSLOptions(reload.tlsConfiguration().getSSLOptions());
        // Or update the SSLContext.
    }

}
----

=== Periodic reloading

The TLS registry includes a built-in mechanism for periodically checking the file system for changes and reloading certificates.
The `reload-period` property specifies the interval for reloading certificates and emits a `CertificateUpdatedEvent` each time certificates are reloaded.

. To configure periodic certificate reloading:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.reload-period=1h
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.cert=tls.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.key=tls.key
----

. For each named configuration, you can set a specific reload period:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.http.reload-period=30m
quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.cert=tls.crt
quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.key=tls.key
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Impacted servers and clients might need to listen to the `CertificateUpdatedEvent` to apply the new certificates.
This is automatically handled for the Quarkus HTTP, REST, gRPC, and WebSocket servers, as well as the management interface if enabled.
On the client side, Quarkus REST Client automatically handles certificate update events.
====

NOTE: In Quarkus dev mode, when files are touched, it will trigger the `CertificateUpdatedEvent` much more frequently.

ifndef::no-kubernetes-secrets-or-cert-manager[]
== Using Kubernetes secrets or cert-manager

When running in Kubernetes, you can use Kubernetes secrets to store the keystores and truststores.

=== Using Kubernetes secrets

. By using the secret below as an example, create a secret with the keystores and truststores to use Kubernetes secrets:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  tls.crt: ...
  tls.key: ...
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-certs
type: kubernetes.io/tls
----

. Mount the secret as a volume in the pod, which is the easiest way to use these certificates:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: demo
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

        app.kubernetes.io/name: demo
        app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          image: ...
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          name: demo
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8443 # Configure the port to be HTTPS
              name: http
              protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /certs
              name: my-volume
      volumes:
        - name: my-volume
          secret:
            defaultMode: 0666 # Set the permissions, otherwise the pod may not be able to read the files
            optional: false
            secretName: my-certs # Reference the secret
----

. Configure the TLS registry to use the certificates:
+
[source,properties]
----
# ...
# TLS Registry configuration
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.cert=/certs/tls.crt
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.key=/certs/tls.key

# HTTP server configuration:
%prod.quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=http
%prod.quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
----
+
You can combine this with the periodic reloading to automatically reload the certificates when they change.

=== Using cert-manager

When running in Kubernetes, you can use cert-manager to generate and renew certificates automatically.
Cert-manager produces a secret containing the keystores and truststores.
Configuring the TLS registry is the same as when using Kubernetes secrets.
The generated secret includes the following files:

* `tls.crt` for the certificate
* `tls.key` for the private key
* `ca.crt` for the CA certificate (if needed)

. To configure automatic certificate renewal, use the periodic reloading mechanism:

[source,properties]
----
# ...
# TLS Registry configuration
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.cert=/certs/tls.crt
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.key=/certs/tls.key
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.reload-period=24h

# HTTP server configuration:
%prod.quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=http
%prod.quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
----

== Working with OpenShift serving certificates

When running your application in OpenShift, you can use the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html[OpenShift serving certificates] to generate and renew TLS certificates automatically.
The Quarkus TLS registry can use these certificates and Certificate Authority (CA) files to handle HTTPS traffic and validate certificates securely.

[[acquiring-a-certificate]]
=== Acquiring a certificate

To have OpenShift generate a serving certificate, annotate an existing _Service_ object.
The generated certificate will be stored in a secret, which you can then mount in your pod.

The following snippet uses an example _Service_ object with an annotation for generating a TLS certificate.

. View the configuration of the _Service_ object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: quarkus
  name: hero-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 443
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
  type: ClusterIP
----

. To generate a certificate, add his annotation to your already created OpenShift `service`:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc annotate service hero-service \
     service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=my-tls-secret
----
+
The annotation `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` instructs OpenShift to generate a certificate and store it in a secret named `my-tls-secret`.

. Mount the secret as a volume in your pod by updating your _Deployment_ configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/version: ...

        app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: my-tls-secret  # <1>
          secret:
            secretName: my-tls-secret
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
            - name: QUARKUS_TLS_KEY_STORE_PEM_ACME_CERT # <2>
              value: /etc/tls/tls.crt
            - name: QUARKUS_TLS_KEY_STORE_PEM_ACME_KEY
              value: /etc/tls/tls.key
          image: ...
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          name: my-service
          volumeMounts:  # <3>
            - name: my-tls-secret
              mountPath: /etc/tls
              readOnly: true
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8443  # <4>
              name: https
              protocol: TCP
----
<1> Define a volume to mount the secret.
Use the same name as the secret declared above.
<2> Set up the keystore with the paths to the certificate and private key.
This can be configured by using environment variables or configuration files.
This example uses environment variables.
OpenShift serving certificates always create the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` files.
<3> Mount the secret in the container.
Ensure that the path matches the one used in the configuration (here `/etc/tls`).
<4> Configure the port to serve HTTPS.
+
. Deploy your application to use the certificate generated by OpenShift.
This will make the service available over HTTPS.

[NOTE]
====
By setting the `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.acme.cert` and `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.acme.key` variables or their environment variable variant, the TLS registry will use the certificate and private key from the secret.

This configures the default keystore for the Quarkus HTTP server, which allows the server to use the certificate.
For information about using this certificate in a named configuration, see xref:referencing-a-tls-configuration[].
====

=== Trusting the Certificate Authority (CA)

.Prerequisites
* <<acquiring-a-certificate>>

Now that your service uses a certificate issued by OpenShift, configure your client applications to trust this certificate.
To do so, create a ConfigMap that holds the CA certificate, and then configure the pod to mount it.
The following steps use a Quarkus REST client as an example, but the same approach applies to any client.

. Start by defining an _empty_ ConfigMap, which will be populated with the CA certificate:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: client-tls-config
  annotations:
    service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle: "true"
----
+
The `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle` annotation is used to inject the CA certificate into the ConfigMap.
Note that the ConfigMap initially has no data — it is empty.
During its processing, OpenShift injects the CA certificate into the ConfigMap in the `service-ca.crt` file.

. Mount the ConfigMap by adding a volume and mounting it in your _Deployment_ configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-service-client
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
      app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
        app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-service-client
          image: ...
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts: # <1>
            - name: my-client-volume
              mountPath: /deployments/tls
      volumes: # <2>
        - name: my-client-volume
          configMap:
            name: client-tls-config
----
<1> Mount the ConfigMap in the container.
Ensure that the path matches the one used in the configuration (in this example `/deployments/tls`).
<2> Define a volume to mount the ConfigMap and reference the ConfigMap that receives the CA certificate.

. Configure the REST client to use this CA certificate.
+
Consider the following REST client interface:
+
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

@RegisterRestClient(baseUri = "https://hero-service.cescoffi-dev.svc", configKey = "hero") // <1>
public interface HeroClient {

    record Hero (Long id, String name, String otherName, int level, String picture, String powers) {
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/api/heroes/random")
    Hero getRandomHero();

}
----
<1> Configure the base URI and the configuration key.
The name must be in the format `<service-name>.<namespace>.svc`.
Otherwise, the certificate will not be trusted.
Ensure that the `configKey` is also configured.

. Configure the REST client to trust the CA certificate generated by OpenShift:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.rest-client.hero.tls-configuration-name=my-service-tls # <1>
quarkus.tls.my-service-tls.trust-store.pem.certs=/deployments/tls/service-ca.crt # <2>
----
<1> Configure the `hero` REST client with the TLS configuration named `my-service-tls`.
<2> Set up the `my-service-tls` TLS configuration, specifically the truststore with the CA certificate.
Ensure the path matches the one used in the Kubernetes _Deployment_ configuration.
The file is always named `service-ca.crt`.

=== Certificate renewal

OpenShift automatically renews the serving certificates it generates.
When the certificate is renewed, the secret is updated with the new certificate and private key.

To ensure your application uses the new certificate, you can use the periodic reloading feature of the Quarkus TLS registry.

By setting the `reload-period` property, the TLS registry will periodically check the keystores and truststores for changes and reload them if needed:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.reload-period=24h
----

. Optionally, implement a custom mechanism to reload the certificates when the secret is updated.
See <<reloading-certificates>> for more information.

== Quarkus CLI commands and development Certificate Authority

The TLS registry provides Quarkus CLI commands to generate a development Certificate Authority (CA) and trusted certificates.
This avoids having to use self-signed certificates locally.

The following snippet shows the description of the `quarkus tls` command, containing two sub-commands:
[source,shell]
----
> quarkus tls
Install and Manage TLS development certificates
Usage: tls [COMMAND]
Commands:
  generate-quarkus-ca   Generate Quarkus Dev CA certificate and private key. <1>
  generate-certificate  Generate a TLS certificate with the Quarkus Dev CA if
                        available. <2>
----
<1> This is useful for local development, as it allows Quarkus to act as its own certificate authority, which can be used to sign other certificates.
<2> This is useful when creating a certificate for secure communication between your application and external services or clients during development.

In most cases, you generate the Quarkus Development CA once and then generate certificates signed by this CA.
The Quarkus Development CA is a Certificate Authority that can be used to sign certificates locally.
It is only valid for development purposes and only trusted on the local machine.
The generated CA is located in `$HOME/.quarkus/quarkus-dev-root-ca.pem`, and installed in the system truststore.

=== Understanding self-signed versus CA-signed certificates

When developing with TLS, you can use two types of certificates:

* **Self-signed certificate**: The certificate is signed by the same entity that uses it.
It is not trusted by default.
This type of certificate is typically used when a Certificate Authority (CA) is unavailable or when a simple setup is needed.
It is not suitable for production and is intended only for development.

* **CA-signed certificate**: The certificate is signed by a Certificate CA, a trusted entity.
This certificate is trusted by default and is the standard choice for production environments.

While you can use a self-signed certificate for local development, it has limitations.
Browsers and tools like `curl`, `wget`, and `httpie` typically do not trust self-signed certificates, requiring manual import of the CA in your operating system.

To avoid this issue, use a development CA to sign certificates and install the CA in the system truststore.
This ensures that the system trusts all certificates signed by the CA.
Quarkus simplifies the generation of a development CA and the certificates that are signed by this CA.

[[generate-a-development-ca]]
=== Generate a development CA

The development CA is a Certificate Authority that can be used to sign certificates locally.
Note that the generated CA is only valid for development purposes and can only be trusted on the local machine.

To generate a development CA:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus tls generate-quarkus-ca --install \   <1>
     --renew \     <2>
     --truststore  <3>
----
<1> `--install` installs the CA in the system truststore.
Windows, Mac, and Linux (Fedora and Ubuntu) are supported.
However, depending on your browser, you might need to import the generated CA manually.
Refer to your browser's documentation for more information.
The generated CA is located in `$HOME/.quarkus/quarkus-dev-root-ca.pem`.
<2> `--renew` renews the CA if it already exists.
When this option is used, the private key is changed, so you need to regenerate the certificates signed by the CA.
If the CA expires, it will automatically renew without requiring the `--renew` option.
<3> `--truststore` also generates a PKCS12 truststore containing the CA certificate.

WARNING: When installing the certificate, your system might ask for your password to install the certificate in the system truststore or ask for confirmation in a dialog on Windows.

IMPORTANT: On Windows, run as administrator from an elevated terminal to install the CA in the system truststore.

=== Generating a trusted (signed) certificate

.Prerequisites
* <<generate-a-development-ca>>

. After installing the Quarkus Development CA, generate a trusted certificate.
This certificate will be signed by the Quarkus Development CA and trusted by your system.
+
[source,shell]
----
quarkus tls generate-certificate --name my-cert
----
+
This command generates a certificate signed by the Quarkus Development CA, which your system will trust if properly installed or imported.
+
The certificate is stored in `./.certs/`.
Two files are generated:
+
* `$NAME-keystore.p12`: Contains the private key and the certificate.
It is password-protected.
* `$NAME-truststore.p12`: Contains the CA certificate, which you can use as a truststore, for example, for testing.
+
Additional options are available:
+
[source,shell]
----
Usage: tls generate-certificate [-hrV] [-c=<cn>] [-d=<directory>]
       -n=<name> [-p=<password>]
Generate a TLS certificate with the Quarkus Dev CA if available.
  -c, --cn=<cn>       The common name of the certificate. Default is 'localhost'
  -d, --directory=<directory>
                      The directory in which the certificates will be created.
                        Default is `.certs`
  -n, --name=<name>   Name of the certificate. It will be used as file name and
                        alias in the keystore
  -p, --password=<password>
                      The password of the keystore. Default is 'password'
  -r, --renew         Whether existing certificates will need to be replaced
----
+
A `.env` file is also generated when generating the certificate, making the Quarkus dev mode aware of these certificates.

. Run your application in dev mode to use these certificates:
+
[source,shell]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
...
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) demo 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 999-SNAPSHOT) started in 1.286s. Listening on: http://localhost:8080 and https://localhost:8443
----

. Open the Dev UI by using HTTPS: `https://localhost:8443/q/dev` or by issuing a `curl` request:
+
[source,shell]
----
curl https://localhost:8443/hello
Hello from Quarkus REST%
----
+
IMPORTANT: Quarkus generates a self-signed certificate if the Quarkus Development CA is not installed.

=== Generating a self-signed certificate

Even if the Quarkus Development CA is installed, you can generate a self-signed certificate:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus tls generate-certificate --name my-cert --self-signed
----

This generates a self-signed certificate that the Quarkus Development CA does not sign.

=== Uninstalling the Quarkus Development CA

Uninstalling the Quarkus Development CA from your system depends on your OS.

==== Deleting the CA certificate on Windows

. List the CA certificate on Windows by using the Powershell terminal with administrator rights:
+
[source,shell]
----
# First, we need to identify the serial number of the CA certificate
> certutil -store -user Root
root "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
================ Certificate 0 ================
Serial Number: 019036d564c8

== Automatic certificate management with Let's Encrypt

link:https://letsencrypt.org[Let's Encrypt] is a free, automated certificate authority provided by link:https://www.abetterinternet.org/[Internet Security Research Group].

Let's Encrypt uses link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555[Automated certificate management environment (ACME) protocol] to support automatic certificate issuance and renewal.
To learn more about Let's Encrypt and ACME, see link:https://letsencrypt.org/docs/[Let's Encrypt documentation].

The TLS registry extension allows a CLI ACME client to issue and renew Let's Encrypt certificates.
Your application uses this TLS registry extension to resolve ACME protocol challenges.

Follow the steps below to have your Quarkus application prepared and automatically updated with new and renewed Let's Encrypt certificates.

[[lets-encrypt-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

* Ensure that a fully resolvable DNS domain name is available that you can use to access your application.
You can use this domain name to create a Let's Encrypt account and pass the Let's Encrypt ACME challenges to prove that you own this domain.
You can use link:https://ngrok.com/[ngrok] to start experimenting with the Quarkus Let's Encrypt ACME feature; for more information, see the <<lets-encrypt-ngrok,Testing with ngrok>> section below.

* Your Quarkus HTTPS application must use a _build-time_ property to enable a Let's Encrypt ACME challenge route:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.lets-encrypt.enabled=true
----
+
The TLS registry can manage the challenge process from either the main HTTP interface or the management interface.
Using a management interface is **strongly** recommended to let Quarkus deal with ACME challenge configuration separately from the main application's deployment and security requirements:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.lets-encrypt.enabled=true
quarkus.management.enabled=true
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
.Port 80
The Let's Encrypt ACME challenge requires that the application is reachable on port `80`, essentially `http://your-dns-name`.
Ensure the port `80` is accessible from the Internet.
It might require an explicit security policy depending on your hosting provider.

We also recommend setting `quarkus.http.insecure-requests` to `redirect` to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
The ACME challenge accepts self-signed certificates and up to 10 redirections:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.tls.lets-encrypt.enabled=true
quarkus.management.enabled=true
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=redirect
----

====

The challenge is served from the primary HTTP interface, which is accessible from your DNS domain name.

IMPORTANT: Do not start your application yet.

[[lets-encrypt-prepare]]
=== Application preparation

Before you request a Let's Encrypt certificate:

. Move to the root directory of your application.
. Run the TLS registry Let's Encrypt CLI `prepare` command:
+
[source,shell]
----
quarkus tls lets-encrypt prepare --domain=<domain-dns-name>
----
+
The `prepare` command does the following:

* Creates a `.letsencrypt` folder in your application's root directory.
* Creates a self-signed domain certificate and private key for your application configured in the previous <<lets-encrypt-prerequisites,Let's Encrypt prerequisites>> step to start and accept HTTPS requests.
* Creates a `.env` configuration file in the root directory of your application and configures it to use the self-signed domain certificate and private key until you obtain the Let's Encrypt certificate.
+
The following snippet shows an example of the generated `.env` file:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.acme.cert=.letsencrypt/lets-encrypt.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.acme.key=.letsencrypt/lets-encrypt.key
----
+
NOTE: The `.env` file does not contain the `quarkus.tls.lets-encrypt.enabled` and `quarkus.management.enabled` properties as they are build-time properties that require a rebuild of the application.

=== Starting your application

. Start your application:
+
[source,shell]
----
java -jar quarkus-run.jar
----

.. Access your application endpoint by using `https://your-domain-name:8443/`; for example, `https://your-domain-name:8443/hello`, and accept a self-signed certificate in the browser.

.. Keep the application running and request your first Let's Encrypt certificate.

[[lets-encrypt-issue-certificate]]
=== Issue a certificate

. From the application directory, run the `issue-certificate` command to acquire your first Let's Encrypt certificate:
+
[source,shell]
----
quarkus tls lets-encrypt issue-certificate \
  --domain=<domain-dns-name> \ <1>
  --email=<your contact email> \ <2>
  --management-url=https://localhost:9000 <3>
----
<1> Set your domain name.
<2> Provide your contact email address that Let's Encrypt can use to contact you in case of any issues with your Let's Encrypt account.
<3> Set your application management URL, which you can use to handle ACME challenges.
Use `https://localhost:8443/` if you choose not to enable a management router in the <<lets-encrypt-prerequisites,Let's Encrypt prerequisites>> step.

. During the processing of the `issue-certificate` command, the TLS registry CLI performs the following tasks:

* Checks if the application is prepared to serve the challenge.
* Creates and records Let's Encrypt account information.
* Issues a Let's Encrypt certificate request.
* Interacts with the Quarkus application to resolve ACME challenges.
+
[NOTE]
====
When the Let's Encrypt certificate chain and private key have been successfully acquired, they are converted to PEM format and copied to your application's `.letsencrypt` folder.
The TLS registry is informed that a new certificate and private key are ready and reloads them automatically.
====
+
. Access your application's endpoint using `https://your-domain-name:8443/` again.
Confirm in the browser that the Let's Encrypt certificate authority is now signing your domain certificate.
+
Note that currently, the `issue-certificate` command implicitly creates a Let's Encrypt account to make it easy for users to get started with the ACME protocol.
Support for the Let's Encrypt account management will evolve further.

=== Renewing a certificate

Renewing certificates is similar to issuing the first certificate, but it requires an existing account created during the <<lets-encrypt-issue-certificate,Issue certificates with Let's Encrypt>> step.

Run the following command to renew your Let's Encrypt certificate and set your domain DNS name:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus tls lets-encrypt renew-certificate \
  --domain=<domain-dns-name>
----

During this command, TLS registry CLI reads a Let's Encrypt account information recorded during the <<lets-encrypt-issue-certificate,Issue certificates with Let's Encrypt>> step, issues a Let's Encrypt certificate request, and communicates with a Quarkus application to have ACME challenges resolved.

Once the Let's Encrypt certificate chain and private key have been successfully renewed, they are converted to PEM format and copied to your application's `.letsencrypt` folder.
The TLS registry is notified when a new certificate and private key are ready, and it automatically reloads them.

[[lets-encrypt-ngrok]]
=== Testing with ngrok

link:https://ngrok.com/[ngrok] can be used to provide a secure HTTPS tunnel to your application running on localhost, and make it easy to test HTTPS based applications.

ngrok provides a simplified way of getting started with the Quarkus Let's Encrypt ACME feature.

. Initiate testing by asking ngrok to reserve a domain:
+
You can use link:https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-ngrok[Quarkiverse ngrok] in dev mode or reserve it directly in the ngrok dashboard.
Unfortunately, you cannot use your ngrok domain to test the Quarkus Let's Encrypt ACME feature immediately.
This is because ngrok itself uses Let's Encrypt and intercepts ACME challenges that are meant to be handled by the Quarkus application instead.

. Therefore, remove the ngrok Let's Encrypt certificate policy from your ngrok domain:
+
[source,shell]
----
ngrok api --api-key <YOUR-API-KEY> reserved-domains delete-certificate-management-policy <YOUR-RESERVED-DOMAIN-ID>
----
+
`YOUR-RESERVED-DOMAIN-ID` is your reserved domain's id which starts from `rd_`, you can find it in the link:https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains[ngrok dashboard domains section].

. Because ngrok only forwards ACME challenges over HTTP, start ngrok by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
ngrok http --domain <YOUR-NGROK-DOMAIN> 8080 --scheme http <1>
----
<1> `8080` is the localhost HTTP port your application is listening on.
Note that the application will be accessible from `http://YOUR-NGROK-DOMAIN` on port `80` but redirected to your local machine on port `8080`.

. Test the Quarkus Let's Encrypt ACME feature from your local machine.
