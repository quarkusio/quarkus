In the Quarkus Security framework, identity providers play a crucial role in authentication and authorization by  verifying user identities.
`IdentityProvider` creates a `SecurityIdentity` instance, which gets used during user authentication to verify and authorize access requests to your Quarkus application.

[[identity-providers]]
`IdentityProvider` converts the authentication credentials provided by `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` to a `SecurityIdentity` instance.

Some extensions, for example, `OIDC`, `OAuth2`, and `SmallRye JWT`, have inline `IdentityProvider` implementations specific to the supported authentication flow.
For example, `quarkus-oidc` uses its own `IdentityProvider` to convert a token to a `SecurityIdentity` instance.

If you use Basic or form-based authentication, you must add an `IdentityProvider` instance to convert a username and password to a `SecurityIdentity` instance.

To get started with security in Quarkus, consider combining the Quarkus built-in Basic HTTP authentication with the Jakarta Persistence identity provider to enable role-based access control (RBAC).
