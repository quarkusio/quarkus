     * as the string returned by `java.sql.DatabaseMetaData#getDatabaseProductVersion()`
     * for your database's JDBC driver.
     * This numbering scheme may be different from the most popular one for your database;
     * for example Microsoft SQL Server 2016 would be version `13`.
     *
     * As a rule, the version set here should be as high as possible,
     * but must be lower than or equal to the version of any database your application will connect to.
     *
     * A high version will allow better performance and using more features
     * (e.g. Hibernate ORM may generate more efficient SQL,
     * avoid workarounds and take advantage of more database features),
     * but if it is higher than the version of the database you want to connect to,
     * it may lead to runtime exceptions
     * (e.g. Hibernate ORM may generate invalid SQL that your database will reject).
     *
     * Some extensions (like the Hibernate ORM extension)
     * will try to check this version against the actual database version on startup,
     * leading to a startup failure when the actual version is lower
     * or simply a warning in case the database cannot be reached.
     *
     * The default for this property is specific to each extension;
     * the Hibernate ORM extension will default to the oldest version it supports.
