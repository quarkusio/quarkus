# Cache Settings Issue Analysis

## Problem
The cache property is always `null` in the graph.json file, despite having logic to set it to `true` or `false`.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Data Flow Analysis
- **TypeScript Plugin**: Correctly passes through data from Kotlin analyzer ✅
- **CreateNodesResultGenerator**: Correctly copies cache property on line 121 ✅
- **TargetGenerationService**: Calls `shouldEnableCaching()` on lines 118, 241, 318 ✅
- **TargetConfiguration Model**: Has `cache` property defined as `Boolean?` ✅

### 2. Raw Output Analysis
- All 60,558 cache properties in maven-analysis.json are `null`
- No instances of `"cache": true` or `"cache": false` found
- This indicates the Kotlin code is not setting the cache property correctly

### 3. Logic Analysis
The `shouldEnableCaching()` method should return `true` for most goals like:
- `compile` → true
- `enforce` → true  
- `create` → true

But all cache values are `null`, suggesting the return value isn't being assigned.

## Next Steps
1. Check if there's a logic error in the Kotlin cache assignment
2. Add debug logging to verify the cache setting process
3. Test with a simple case to isolate the issue
