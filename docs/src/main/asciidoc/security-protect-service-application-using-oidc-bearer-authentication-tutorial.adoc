= Protect a service application by using OIDC bearer authentication
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: security

Here, you use the Quarkus OpenID Connect (OIDC) extension to secure a JAX-RS application using Bearer authentication.
The bearer tokens are issued by OIDC and OAuth 2.0 compliant authorization servers, such as link:https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak].

To better understand OIDC Bearer authentication, see xref:security-oidc-bearer-authentication-concept.adoc[OIDC Bearer authentication].

== Prerequisites

:prerequisites-docker:
include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq tool]

== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple microservice which offers two endpoints:

* `/api/users/me`
* `/api/admin`

These endpoints are protected and can only be accessed if a client is sending a bearer token along with the request, which must be valid (e.g.: signature, expiration and audience) and trusted by the microservice.

The bearer token is issued by a Keycloak Server and represents the subject to which the token was issued for. For being an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, the token also references the client acting on behalf of the user.

The `/api/users/me` endpoint can be accessed by any user with a valid token. As a response, it returns a JSON document with details about the user where these details are obtained from the information carried on the token.

The `/api/admin` endpoint is protected with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) where only users granted with the `admin` role can access. At this endpoint, we use the `@RolesAllowed` annotation to declaratively enforce the access constraint.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `security-openid-connect-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-quickstart[directory].

== Procedure


=== Create the Maven project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

:create-app-artifact-id: security-openid-connect-quickstart
:create-app-extensions: oidc,resteasy-reactive-jackson
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

This command generates a Maven project, importing the `oidc` extension
which is an implementation of OIDC for Quarkus.

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `oidc` extension
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

:add-extension-extensions: oidc
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

This will add the following to your build file:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-oidc")
----

=== Write the application

Let's start by implementing the `/api/users/me` endpoint. As you can see from the source code below it is just a regular JAX-RS resource:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.openid.connect;

import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import org.jboss.resteasy.reactive.NoCache;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;

@Path("/api/users")
public class UsersResource {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity securityIdentity;

    @GET
    @Path("/me")
    @RolesAllowed("user")
    @NoCache
    public User me() {
        return new User(securityIdentity);
    }

    public static class User {

        private final String userName;

        User(SecurityIdentity securityIdentity) {
            this.userName = securityIdentity.getPrincipal().getName();
        }

        public String getUserName() {
            return userName;
        }
    }
}
----

The source code for the `/api/admin` endpoint is also very simple. The main difference here is that we are using a `@RolesAllowed` annotation to make sure that only users granted with the `admin` role can access the endpoint:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.openid.connect;

import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/api/admin")
public class AdminResource {

    @GET
    @RolesAllowed("admin")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String admin() {
        return "granted";
    }
}
----

Injection of the `SecurityIdentity` is supported in both `@RequestScoped` and `@ApplicationScoped` contexts.

=== Configure the application

Configure the Quarkus OpenID Connect (OIDC) extension by setting the following configuration properties in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

[source,properties]
----
%prod.quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=backend-service
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret

# Tell Dev Services for Keycloak to import the realm file
# This property is not effective when running the application in JVM or Native modes

quarkus.keycloak.devservices.realm-path=quarkus-realm.json
----

Where:

* `%prod.quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` sets the base URL of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) server. The `%prod.` profile prefix ensures that `Dev Services for Keycloak` launches a container when you run the application in dev mode. See <<keycloak-dev-mode, Running the Application in Dev mode>> section below for more information.
* `quarkus.oidc.client-id` sets a client-id that identifies the application.
* `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret` sets the client secret, which is used by the `client_secret_basic` authentication method.

For more information, see xref:security-openid-connect-oidc-configuration-properties-reference.adoc[OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration properties].

=== Start and configure the Keycloak server

NOTE: Do not start the Keycloak server when you run the application in a dev mode - `Dev Services for Keycloak` will launch a container. See <<keycloak-dev-mode, Running the Application in Dev mode>> section below for more information. Make sure to put the {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] on the classpath (`target/classes` directory) so that it gets imported automatically when running in dev mode - unless you have already built a {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-quickstart[complete solution] in which case this realm file will be added to the classpath during the build.

To start a Keycloak Server you can use Docker and just run the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin -p 8180:8080 quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:{keycloak.version} start-dev
----

where `keycloak.version` should be set to `17.0.0` or higher.

You should be able to access your Keycloak Server at http://localhost:8180[localhost:8180].

Log in as the `admin` user to access the Keycloak Administration Console. Username should be `admin` and password `admin`.

Import the {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] to create a new realm. For more details, see the Keycloak documentation about how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_create-realm[create a new realm].

NOTE: If you want to use the Keycloak Admin Client to configure your server from your application you need to include the
either `quarkus-keycloak-admin-client` or the `quarkus-keycloak-admin-client-reactive` (if the application uses `quarkus-rest-client-reactive`) extension.
See the xref:security-keycloak-admin-client.adoc[Quarkus Keycloak Admin Client] guide for more information.

[[keycloak-dev-mode]]
=== Run the application in Dev mode

To run the application in a dev mode, use:

include::{includes}/devtools/dev.adoc[]

xref:security-openid-connect-dev-services.adoc[Dev Services for Keycloak] will launch a Keycloak container and import a `quarkus-realm.json`.

Open a xref:dev-ui.adoc[Dev UI] available at http://localhost:8080/q/dev[/q/dev] and click on a `Provider: Keycloak` link in an `OpenID Connect` `Dev UI` card.

You will be asked to log in into a `Single Page Application` provided by `OpenID Connect Dev UI`:

 * Login as `alice` (password: `alice`) who has a `user` role
 ** accessing `/api/admin` will return `403`
 ** accessing `/api/users/me` will return `200`
 * Logout and login as `admin` (password: `admin`) who has both `admin` and `user` roles
 ** accessing `/api/admin` will return `200`
 ** accessing `/api/users/me` will return `200`

=== Run the Application in JVM mode

When you're done playing with the `dev` mode" you can run it as a standard Java application.

First compile it:

include::{includes}/devtools/build.adoc[]

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

=== Run the application in Native mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code: no modifications required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your
production environment, as the runtime technology is included in
the produced binary, and optimized to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compilation will take a bit longer, so this step is disabled by default;
let's build again by enabling the `native` profile:

include::{includes}/devtools/build-native.adoc[]

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/security-openid-connect-quickstart-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----

=== Test the application

See <<keycloak-dev-mode, Running the Application in Dev mode>> section above about testing your application in a dev mode.

You can test the application launched in JVM or Native modes with `curl`.

The application is using Bearer authentication and the first thing to do is obtain an access token from the Keycloak Server in
order to access the application resources:

[source,bash]
----
export access_token=$(\
    curl --insecure -X POST http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=alice&password=alice&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 )
----

The example above obtains an access token for user `alice`.

Any user is allowed to access the
`http://localhost:8080/api/users/me` endpoint
which basically returns a JSON payload with details about the user.

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/api/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer "$access_token
----

The `http://localhost:8080/api/admin` endpoint can only be accessed by users with the `admin` role. If you try to access this endpoint with the
 previously issued access token, you should get a `403` response
 from the server.

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -X GET \
   http://localhost:8080/api/admin \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer "$access_token
----

In order to access the admin endpoint you should obtain a token for the `admin` user:

[source,bash]
----
export access_token=$(\
    curl --insecure -X POST http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=admin&password=admin&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 )
----
