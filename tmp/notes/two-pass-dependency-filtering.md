# Two-Pass Dependency Filtering Implementation

## Major Success ✅

Implemented a two-pass approach to fix dependency filtering issues by first discovering all projects, then filtering dependencies.

### The Problem:
- Dependencies were referencing projects that didn't exist in the workspace (like `quarkus-fs-util`)
- This caused "Configuration Error" and "Source project file is required" errors
- Dependencies were pointing to external artifacts not built in the current repository

### The Solution:

#### Pass 1: Project Discovery
```java
discoverAllProjects(rootPomPath, workspaceRoot, processedPomPaths, discoveredProjects, stats);
```
- Traverse the entire Maven module hierarchy
- Collect all project names: `groupId:artifactId`
- Build a complete list of projects that exist in the workspace

#### Pass 2: Filtered Configuration Generation  
```java
traverseModulesWithFiltering(rootPomPath, workspaceRoot, processedPomPaths, discoveredProjects, stats, firstProject, writer);
```
- Generate project configurations
- Filter dependencies to only include projects from the discovered list:
```java
if (discoveredProjects.contains(depName)) {
    internalDeps.add(depName);
}
```

### Results:
- ✅ **949 projects** discovered in Pass 1
- ✅ **949 projects** successfully processed in Pass 2  
- ✅ **No more "Configuration Error"** about missing dependencies
- ✅ Dependencies are now properly filtered to workspace projects only
- ✅ Hierarchical Maven structure preserved

### Status:
Projects load successfully without dependency errors. Final step needed: fix TypeScript dependency creation format mismatch.
