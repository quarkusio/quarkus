# Maven Enforcer Debug Analysis

## Current Status
- Our fix to include `@executionId` in goal strings is implemented in `createGoalTarget()`
- However, the BOM still generates: `"org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-enforcer-plugin:enforce"`
- The metadata shows: `"executionId": "enforce"` 
- This suggests the target generation is working, but the goal construction isn't

## Key Observations
1. The BOM inherits from `quarkus-project` (root), not `quarkus-build-parent`
2. The BOM doesn't have its own enforcer plugin configuration
3. Yet Nx detects an `executionId: "enforce"`
4. Manual Maven commands show the enforcer works: `mvn validate` ✅, `mvn enforce@enforce` ✅

## Questions
1. Where is the BOM getting the enforcer execution from?
2. Why isn't our fix applying to this target?
3. Is this target being generated via a different code path?

## Next Steps
1. Add debug logging to see which method is creating the enforcer target
2. Check if the execution has a valid `id` field when the target is created
3. Verify the inheritance mechanism - how does BOM get enforcer configuration?
