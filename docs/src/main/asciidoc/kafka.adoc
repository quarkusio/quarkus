This reference guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can utilize SmallRye Reactive Messaging to interact with Apache Kafka.

== Introduction

https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka] is a popular open-source distributed event streaming platform.
It is used commonly for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.
Similar to a message queue, or an enterprise messaging platform, it lets you:

- *publish* (write) and *subscribe* to (read) streams of events, called _records_.
- *store* streams of records durably and reliably inside _topics_.
- *process* streams of records as they occur or retrospectively.

And all this functionality is provided in a distributed, highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and secure manner.

== Quarkus Extension for Apache Kafka

Quarkus provides support for Apache Kafka through https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/[Smallrye Reactive Messaging] framework.
Based on Eclipse MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification 2.0, it proposes a flexible programming model bridging CDI and event-driven.

[NOTE]
====
This guide provides an in-depth look on Apache Kafka and Smallrye Reactive Messaging framework.
For a quick start take a look at xref:kafka-reactive-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started to SmallRye Reactive Messaging with Apache Kafka].
====

You can add the `smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka` extensions to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka"
----

This will add the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Configuring Smallrye Kafka Connector

Because Smallrye Reactive Messaging framework supports different messaging backends like Apache Kafka, AMQP, Apache Camel, JMS, MQTT, etc., it employs a generic vocabulary:

- Applications send and receive *messages*. A message wraps a _payload_ and can be extended with some _metadata_. With the Kafka connector, a _message_ corresponds to a Kafka _record_.
- Messages transit on *channels*. Application components connect to channels to publish and consume messages. The Kafka connector maps _channels_ to Kafka _topics_.
- Channels are connected to message backends using *connectors*. Connectors are configured to map incoming messages to a specific channel (consumed by the application) and collect outgoing messages sent to a specific channel. Each connector is dedicated to a specific messaging technology. For example, the connector dealing with Kafka is named `smallrye-kafka`.

A minimal configuration for the Kafka connector with an incoming channel looks like the following:

[source, properties]
----
%prod.kafka.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092 <1>
mp.messaging.incoming.prices.connector=smallrye-kafka <2>
----

<1> Configure the broker location for the production profile. You can configure it globally or per channel using `mp.messaging.incoming.$channel.bootstrap.servers` property.
In dev mode and when running tests, link:kafka-dev-services[Dev Services for Kafka] automatically starts a Kafka broker.
When not provided this property defaults to `localhost:9092`.
<2> Configure the connector to manage the prices channel. By default the topic name is same as the channel name. You can configure the topic attribute to override it.

NOTE: The `%prod` prefix indicates that the property is only used when the application runs in prod mode (so not in dev or test). Refer to the xref:config-reference.adoc#profiles[Profile documentation] for further details.

== Receiving messages from Kafka

Continuing from the previous minimal configuration, your Quarkus application can receive message payload directly:

[source, java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class PriceConsumer {

    @Incoming("prices")
    public void consume(double price) {
        // process your price.
    }

}
----

There are several other ways your application can consume incoming messages:

.Message
[source, java]
----
@Incoming("prices")
public CompletionStage<Void> consume(Message<Double> msg) {
    // access record metadata
    var metadata = msg.getMetadata(IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata.class).orElseThrow();
    // process the message payload.
    double price = msg.getPayload();
    // Acknowledge the incoming message (commit the offset)
    return msg.ack();
}
----

`Message` type lets the consuming method to access the incoming message metadata and handle the acknowledgment manually.
We'll explore different acknowledgment strategies in <<commit-strategies>>.

If you want to access the Kafka record objects directly, use:

.ConsumerRecord
[source, java]
----
@Incoming("prices")
public void consume(ConsumerRecord<String, Double> record) {
    String key = record.key(); // Can be `null` if the incoming record has no key
    String value = record.value(); // Can be `null` if the incoming record has no value
    String topic = record.topic();
    int partition = record.partition();
    // ...
}
----

`ConsumerRecord` is provided by the underlying Kafka client and can be injected directly to the consumer method.
Another simpler approach consists in using `Record`:

.Record
[source, java]
----
@Incoming("prices")
public void consume(Record<String, Double> record) {
    String key = record.key(); // Can be `null` if the incoming record has no key
    String value = record.value(); // Can be `null` if the incoming record has no value
}
----

`Record` is a simple wrapper around key and payload of the incoming Kafka record.

.@Channel

Alternatively, your application can inject a `Multi` in your bean and subscribe to its events as the following example:

[source, java]
----
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;
import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Channel;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.SseElementType;

@Path("/prices")
public class PriceResource {

    @Inject
    @Channel("prices") Multi<Double> prices;

    @GET
    @Path("/prices")
    @Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
    @SseElementType("text/plain")
    public Multi<Double> stream() {
        return prices;
    }
}
----

This is a good example of how to integrate a Kafka consumer with another downstream,
in this example exposing it as a Server-Sent Events endpoint.


[NOTE]
====
When consuming messages with `@Channel`, the application code is responsible for the subscription.
In the example above RESTEasy endpoint handles that for you.
====

Following types can be injected as channels:

[source, java]
----
@Inject @Channel("prices") Multi<Double> streamOfPayloads;

@Inject @Channel("prices") Multi<Message<Double>> streamOfMessages;

@Inject @Channel("prices") Publisher<Double> publisherOfPayloads;

@Inject @Channel("prices") Publisher<Message<Double>> publisherOfMessages;
----

As with the previous `Message` example, if your injected channel receives payloads (`Multi<T>`), it acknowledges the message automatically, and support multiple subscribers.
If you injected channel receives Message (`Multi<Message<T>>`), you will be responsible for the acknowledgment and broadcasting.
We will explore sending broadcast messages in <<broadcasting-messages-on-multiple-consumers>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Injecting `@Channel("prices")` or having `@Incoming("prices")` does not automatically configure the application to consume messages from Kafka.
You need to configure an inbound connector with `mp.messageing.incoming.prices...` or have an `@Outgoing("prices")` somewhere in your application (meaning a method generating messages transiting on the channel "prices").
====

=== Blocking processing

You often need to combine Reactive Messaging with blocking processing such as database interactions.
For this, you need to use the `@Blocking` annotation indicating that the processing is _blocking_ and should not be run on the caller thread.

For example, The following code illustrates how you can store incoming payloads to a database using Hibernate with Panache:

[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Blocking;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.transaction.Transactional;

@ApplicationScoped
public class PriceStorage {

    @Incoming("prices")
    @Blocking
    @Transactional
    public void store(int priceInUsd) {
        Price price = new Price();
        price.value = priceInUsd;
        price.persist();
    }

}
----

The complete example is available in the `kafka-panache-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/kafka-panache-quickstart[directory].

[NOTE]
====
There are 2 `@Blocking` annotations:

1. `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Blocking`
2. `io.smallrye.common.annotation.Blocking`

They have the same effect.
Thus, you can use both.
The first one provides more fine-grain tuning such as the worker pool to use and whether it preserves the order.
The second one, used also with other reactive features of Quarkus, uses the default worker pool and preserves the order.
====

=== Acknowledgment Strategies

All messages received by a consumer must be acknowledged.
In the absence of acknowledgment, the processing is considered on error.
If the consumer method receives a `Record` or a payload, the message will be acked on method return, also known as `Strategy.POST_PROCESSING`.
If the consumer method returns another reactive stream or `CompletableStage`, the message will be acked when the downstream message is acked.
// No, it will be ack then the produced message get acked -> Needs confirmation
You can override the default behavior to ack the message on arrival (`Strategy.PRE_PROCESSING`),
or do not ack the message at all (`Strategy.NONE`) on the consumer method as in the following example:

[source, java]
----
@Incoming("prices")
@Acknowledgment(Acknowledgment.Strategy.PRE_PROCESSING)
public void process(double price) {
    // process price
}
----

If the consumer method receives a `Message`, the acknowledgment strategy is `Strategy.MANUAL`
and the consumer method is in charge of ack/nack the message.

[source, java]
----
@Incoming("prices")
public CompletableStage<Void> process(Message<Double> msg) {
    // process price
    return msg.ack();
}
----

As mentioned above, the method can also override the acknowledgment strategy to `PRE_PROCESSING` or `NONE`.

[[commit-strategies]]
=== Commit Strategies

When a message produced from a Kafka record is acknowledged, the connector invokes a commit strategy. 
These strategies decide when the consumer offset for a specific topic/partition is committed. 
Committing an offset indicates that all previous records have been processed. 
It is also the position where the application would restart the processing after a crash recovery or a restart.

Committing every offset has performance penalties as Kafka offset management can be slow. 
However, not committing the offset often enough may lead to message duplication if the application crashes between two commits.

The Kafka connector supports three strategies:

- `throttled` keeps track of received messages and commits to the next offset after the latest acked message in sequence.
This strategy guarantees at-least-once delivery even if the channel performs asynchronous processing.
The connector tracks the received records and periodically (period specified by `auto.commit.interval.ms` (default: 5000 ms)) commits the highest consecutive offset.
The connector will be marked as unhealthy if a message associated with a record is not acknowledged in `throttled.unprocessed-record-max-age.ms` (default: 60000 ms).
Indeed, this strategy cannot commit the offset as soon as a single record processing fails (see <<error-handling>> to configure what happens on failing processing).
If `throttled.unprocessed-record-max-age.ms` is set to less than or equal to `0`, it does not perform any health check verification.
Such a setting might lead to running out of memory if there are "poison pill" messages.
This strategy is the default if `enable.auto.commit` is not explicitly set to true.

- `latest` commits the record offset received by the Kafka consumer as soon as the associated message is acknowledged (if the offset is higher than the previously committed offset).
This strategy provides at-least-once delivery if the channel processes the message without performing any asynchronous processing.
This strategy should not be used on high-load as offset commit is expensive. However, it reduces the risk of duplicates.

- `ignore` performs no commit. This strategy is the default strategy when the consumer is explicitly configured with `enable.auto.commit` to true.
It delegates the offset commit to the underlying Kafka client.
This strategy provides at-least-once delivery if the channel processes the message without performing any asynchronous operations and when `enable.auto.commit` is set to true.
However, if the processing failed between two commits, messages received after the commit and before the failure will be re-processed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Kafka connector disables the Kafka auto commit when it is not explicitly enabled. This behavior differs from the traditional Kafka consumer.
If high-throughout is important for you, and not limited by the downstream, we recommend to either:

- Use the `throttled` policy
- or set `enable.auto.commit` to true and annotate the consuming method with `@Acknowledgment(Acknowledgment.Strategy.NONE)`
====

[[error-handling]]
=== Error Handling Strategies

If a message produced from a Kafka record is nacked, a failure strategy is applied. The Kafka connector supports three strategies:

- `fail`: fail the application, no more records will be processed (default strategy). The offset of the record that has not been processed correctly is not committed.
- `ignore`: the failure is logged, but the processing continue. The offset of the record that has not been processed correctly is committed.
- `dead-letter-queue`: the offset of the record that has not been processed correctly is committed, but the record is written to a (Kafka) dead letter queue topic.

The strategy is selected using the `failure-strategy` attribute.

In the case of `dead-letter-queue`, you can configure the following attributes:

- `dead-letter-queue.topic`: the topic to use to write the records not processed correctly, default is `dead-letter-topic-$channel`, with `$channel` being the name of the channel.
- `dead-letter-queue.key.serializer`: the serializer used to write the record key on the dead letter queue. By default, it deduces the serializer from the key deserializer.
- `dead-letter-queue.value.serializer`: the serializer used to write the record value on the dead letter queue. By default, it deduces the serializer from the value deserializer.

The record written on the dead letter queue contains a set of additional headers about the original record:

- *dead-letter-reason*: the reason of the failure
- *dead-letter-cause*: the cause of the failure if any
- *dead-letter-topic*: the original topic of the record
- *dead-letter-partition*: the original partition of the record (integer mapped to String)
- *dead-letter-offset*: the original offset of the record (long mapped to String)

==== Retrying processing

You can combine Reactive Messaging with https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-fault-tolerance[SmallRye Fault Tolerance], and retry processing if it failed:

[source, java]
----
@Incoming("kafka")
@Retry(delay = 10, maxRetries = 5)
public void consume(String v) {
   // ... retry if this method throws an exception
}
----

You can configure the delay, the number of retries, the jitter...

If your method returns a `Uni`, you need to add the `@NonBlocking` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Incoming("kafka")
@Incoming("processed")
@Retry(delay = 10, maxRetries = 5)
@NonBlocking
public Uni<String> consume(String v) {
   // ... retry if this method throws an exception or the returned Uni produce a failure
}
----

The incoming messages are acknowledged only once the processing completes successfully.
So, it commits the offset after the successful processing.
If after the retries the processing still failed, the message is _nacked_ and the failure strategy is applied.

=== Consumer Groups

In Kafka, a consumer group is a set of consumers which cooperate to consume data from a topic.
A topic is divided into a set of partitions.
The partitions of a topic are assigned among the consumers in the group, effectively allowing to scale consumption throughput.
Note that each partition is assigned to a single consumer from a group.
However, a consumer can be assigned to multiple partitions if the number of partitions is greater than the number of consumer in the group.

Let's explore briefly different producer/consumer patterns and how to implement them using Quarkus:

. *Single consumer thread inside a consumer group*
+
This is the default behavior of an application subscribing to a Kafka topic: Each Kafka connector will create a single consumer thread and place it inside a single consumer group.
Consumer group id defaults to the application name as set by the `quarkus.application.name` configuration property.
It can also be set using the `kafka.group.id` property.
+
image::kafka-one-app-one-consumer.png[alt=Architecture, width=60%, align=center]

. *Multiple consumer threads inside a consumer group*
+
For a given application instance, the number of consumers inside the consumer group can be configured using `mp.messaging.incoming.$channel.partitions` property.
The partitions of the subscribed topic will be divided among the consumer threads.
Note that if the `partitions` value exceed the number of partitions of the topic, some consumer threads won't be assigned any partitions.
+
image::kafka-one-app-two-consumers.png[alt=Architecture, width=60%, align=center]

. *Multiple consumer applications inside a consumer group*
+
Similar to the previous example, multiple instances of an application can subscribe to a single consumer group, configured via `mp.messaging.incoming.$channel.group.id` property, or left default to the application name.
This in turn will divide partitions of the topic among application instances.
+
image::kafka-two-app-one-consumer-group.png[alt=Architecture, width=60% , align=center]

. *Pub/Sub: Multiple consumer groups subscribed to a topic*
+
Lastly different applications can subscribe independently to same topics setting different *consumer group ids*.
For example, messages published to a topic called _orders_ can be consumed independently on two consumer applications, one with `mp.messaging.incoming.orders.group.id=invoicing` and second with `mp.messaging.incoming.orders.group.id=shipping`.
Different consumer groups can scale thus independently according to the message consumption requirements.
+

==== Consumer Rebalance Listener

Inside a consumer group, as new group members arrive and old members leave, the partitions are re-assigned so that each member receives a proportional share of the partitions.
This is known as rebalancing the group.
To handle offset commit and assigned partitions yourself, you can provide a consumer rebalance listener.
To achieve this, implement the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener` interface and exposed it as a `@Idenfier` bean.
A common use case is to store offset in a separate data store to implement exactly-once semantic, or starting the processing at a specific offset.

The listener is invoked every time the consumer topic/partition assignment changes.
For example, when the application starts, it invokes the `partitionsAssigned` callback with the initial set of topics/partitions associated with the consumer. 
If, later, this set changes, it calls the `partitionsRevoked` and `partitionsAssigned` callbacks again, so you can implement custom logic.

Note that the rebalance listener methods are called from the Kafka polling thread and **will** block the caller thread until completion.
That’s because the rebalance protocol has synchronization barriers, and using asynchronous code in a rebalance listener may be executed after the synchronization barrier.

When topics/partitions are assigned or revoked from a consumer, it pauses the message delivery and resumes once the rebalance completes.

If the rebalance listener handles offset commit on behalf of the user (using the `NONE` commit strategy),
the rebalance listener must commit the offset synchronously in the partitionsRevoked callback.
We also recommend applying the same logic when the application stops.

Unlike the `ConsumerRebalanceListener` from Apache Kafka, the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener` methods pass the Kafka Consumer and the set of topics/partitions.

In the following example we set-up a consumer that always starts on messages from at most 10 minutes ago (or offset 0). 
First we need to provide a bean managed implementation of `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener` annotated with `io.smallrye.common.annotation.Identifier`.
We then must configure our inbound connector to use this bean.

[source, java]
----
package inbound;

import io.smallrye.common.annotation.Identifier;
import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.Consumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.OffsetAndTimestamp;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.TopicPartition;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@ApplicationScoped
@Identifier("rebalanced-example.rebalancer")
public class KafkaRebalancedConsumerRebalanceListener implements KafkaConsumerRebalanceListener {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(KafkaRebalancedConsumerRebalanceListener.class.getName());

    /**
     * When receiving a list of partitions will search for the earliest offset within 10 minutes
     * and seek the consumer to it.
     *
     * @param consumer   underlying consumer
     * @param partitions set of assigned topic partitions
     */
    @Override
    public void onPartitionsAssigned(Consumer<?, ?> consumer, Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
        long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long shouldStartAt = now - 600_000L; //10 minute ago

        Map<TopicPartition, Long> request = new HashMap<>();
        for (TopicPartition partition : partitions) {
            LOGGER.info("Assigned " + partition);
            request.put(partition, shouldStartAt);
        }
        Map<TopicPartition, OffsetAndTimestamp> offsets = consumer.offsetsForTimes(request);
        for (Map.Entry<TopicPartition, OffsetAndTimestamp> position : offsets.entrySet()) {
            long target = position.getValue() == null ? 0L : position.getValue().offset();
            LOGGER.info("Seeking position " + target + " for " + position.getKey());
            consumer.seek(position.getKey(), target);
        }
    }

}
----

[source, java]
----
package inbound;

import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.IncomingKafkaRecord;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Acknowledgment;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage;

@ApplicationScoped
public class KafkaRebalancedConsumer {

    @Incoming("rebalanced-example")
    @Acknowledgment(Acknowledgment.Strategy.NONE)
    public CompletionStage<Void> consume(IncomingKafkaRecord<Integer, String> message) {
        // We don't need to ACK messages because in this example we set offset during consumer re-balance
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
    }

}
----

To configure the inbound connector to use the provided listener we either set the consumer rebalance listener’s identifier:
`mp.messaging.incoming.rebalanced-example.consumer-rebalance-listener.name=rebalanced-example.rebalancer`

Or have the listener’s name be the same as the group id:

`mp.messaging.incoming.rebalanced-example.group.id=rebalanced-example.rebalancer`

Setting the consumer re-balance listener’s name takes precedence over using the group id.


== Sending messages to Kafka

Configuration for the Kafka connector outgoing channels is similar to that of incoming:

[source, properties]
----
%prod.kafka.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092 <1>
mp.messaging.outgoing.prices-out.connector=smallrye-kafka <2>
mp.messaging.outgoing.prices-out.topic=prices <3>
----

<1> Configure the broker location for the production profile. You can configure it globally or per channel using `mp.messaging.outgoing.$channel.bootstrap.servers` property.
In dev mode and when running tests, link:kafka-dev-services[Dev Services for Kafka] automatically starts a Kafka broker.
When not provided this property defaults to `localhost:9092`.
<2> Configure the connector to manage the prices channel.
<3> By default the topic name is same as the channel name. You can configure the topic attribute to override it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Inside an application configuration channel names are unique. Therefore if you'd like to configure an incoming and outgoing channel on the same topic, you will need to name channels differently (like in the examples of this guide, `mp.messaging.incoming.prices` and `mp.messaging.outgoing.prices-out`).
====

Then, your application can generate messages and publish them to the prices channel.
It can use double payloads as in the following snippet:

[source, java]
----
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Random;

@ApplicationScoped
public class KafkaPriceProducer {

    private final Random random = new Random();

    @Outgoing("prices-out")
    public Multi<Double> generate() {
        // Build an infinite stream of random prices
        // It emits a price every second
        return Multi.createFrom().ticks().every(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
            .map(x -> random.nextDouble());
    }

}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You should not call methods annotated with `@Incoming` and/or `@Outgoing` directly from your code. They are invoked by the framework. Having user code invoking them would not have the expected outcome.
====

Note that the `generate` method returns a `Multi<Double>`, which implements the Reactive Streams `Publisher` interface.
This publisher will be used by the framework to generate messages and send it to the configured Kafka topic.

Instead of returning a payload, you can return a `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.Record` to send key/value pairs:

[source, java]
----
@Outgoing("out")
public Multi<Record<String, Double>> generate() {
    return Multi.createFrom().ticks().every(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
        .map(x -> Record.of("my-key", random.nextDouble()));
}
----

Payload can be wrapped inside `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message` to have more control on the written records:

[source, java]
----
@Outgoing("generated-price")
public Multi<Message<Double>> generate() {
    return Multi.createFrom().ticks().every(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
            .map(x -> Message.of(random.nextDouble())
                    .addMetadata(OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata.<String>builder()
                            .withKey("my-key")
                            .withTopic("my-key-prices")
                            .withHeaders(new RecordHeaders().add("my-header", "value".getBytes()))
                            .build()));
}
----

`OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata` allows to set metadata attributes of the Kafka record, such as `key`, `topic`, `partition` or `timestamp`.
One use case is to set dynamically select the destination topic of a message.
In this case, instead of configuring the topic inside your application configuration file, you need to use the outbound metadata to set the name of the topic.

Other than method signatures returning a Reactive Stream `Publisher` (`Multi` being an implementation of `Publisher`), outgoing method can also return single message.
In this case the producer will use this method as generator to create an infinite stream.

[source, java]
----
@Outgoing("prices-out") T generate(); // T excluding Void

@Outgoing("prices-out") Message<T> generate();

@Outgoing("prices-out") CompletionStage<T> generate();

@Outgoing("prices-out") CompletionStage<Message<T>> generate();
----

=== Sending messages with @Emitter

Sometimes, you need to have an imperative way of sending messages.

For example, if you need to send a message to a stream when receiving a POST request inside a REST endpoint.
In this case, you cannot use `@Outgoing` because your method has parameters.

For this, you can use an `Emitter`.

[source, java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/prices")
public class PriceResource {

    @Inject @Channel("price-create") Emitter<Double> priceEmitter;

    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public void addPrice(Double price) {
        CompletionStage<Void> ack = priceEmitter.send(price);
    }
}
----

Sending a payload returns a `CompletionStage`, completed when the message is acked. If the message transmission fails, the `CompletionStage` is completed exceptionally with the reason of the nack.

[NOTE]
====
The `Emitter` configuration is done the same way as the other stream configuration used by `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using the `Emitter` you are sending messages from your imperative code to reactive messaging.
These messages are stored in a queue until they are sent.
If the Kafka producer client can't keep up with messages trying to be sent over to Kafka, this queue can become a memory hog and you may even run out of memory.
You can use `@OnOverflow` to configure back-pressure strategy.
It lets you configure the size of the queue (default is 256) and the strategy to apply when the buffer size is reached. Available strategies are `DROP`, `LATEST`, `FAIL`, `BUFFER`, UNBOUNDED_BUFFER` and `NONE`.
====

With the `Emitter` API you can also encapsulate the outgoing payload inside `Message<T>`. As with the previous examples, `Message` lets you handle the ack/nack cases differently.

[source,java]
----
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/prices")
public class PriceResource {

    @Inject @Channel("price-create") Emitter<Double> priceEmitter;

    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public void addPrice(Double price) {
        priceEmitter.send(Message.of(price)
            .withAck(() -> {
                // Called when the message is acked
                return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
            })
            .withNack(throwable -> {
                // Called when the message is nacked
                return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(null);
            }));
    }
}
----

If you prefer using Reactive Stream APIs you can use `MutinyEmitter` that will return `Uni<Void>` on the send method.
You can therefore use Mutiny APIs for handling downstream messages and errors.

[source,java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.MutinyEmitter;

@Path("/prices")
public class PriceResource {

    @Inject @Channel("price-create") MutinyEmitter<Double> priceEmitter;

    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public Uni<String> addPrice(Double price) {
        return quoteRequestEmitter.send(price)
                .map(x -> "ok")
                .onFailure().recoverWithItem("ko");
    }
}
----

There’s also the ability to block on sending the event to the emitter with `sendAndAwait` method.
It will only return from the method when the event is acked or nacked by the receiver.

[NOTE]
.Deprecation
====
The `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Emitter`, `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Channel` and `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.OnOverflow` classes are now deprecated and replaced by:

* `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter`
* `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel`
* `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.OnOverflow`

The new `Emitter.send` method returns a `CompletionStage` completed when the produced message is acknowledged.
====

=== Write Acknowledgement

When Kafka broker receives a record, its acknowledgement can take time depending on the configuration.
Also, it stores in-memory the records that cannot be written.

By default, the connector does wait for Kafka to acknowledge the record to continue the processing (acknowledging the received Message).
You can disable this by setting the `waitForWriteCompletion` attribute to `false`.

Note that the `acks` attribute has a huge impact on the record acknowledgement.

If a record cannot be written, the message is nacked.

=== Backpressure

The Kafka outbound connector handles back-pressure, monitoring the number of in-flight messages waiting to be written to the Kafka broker.
The number of in-flight messages is configured using the `max-inflight-messages` attribute and defaults to 1024.

The connector only sends that amount of messages concurrently.
No other messages will be sent until at least one in-flight message gets acknowledged by the broker.
Then, the connector writes a new message to Kafka when one of the broker’s in-flight messages get acknowledged.
Be sure to configure Kafka’s `batch.size` and `linger.ms` accordingly.

You can also remove the limit of in-flight messages by setting `max-inflight-messages` to `0`.
However, note that the Kafka Producer may block if the number of requests reaches `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection`.

=== Retrying message dispatch

When the Kafka producer receives an error from the server, if it is a transient, recoverable error, the client will retry sending the batch of messages.
This behavior is controlled by `retries` and `retry.backoff.ms` parameters.
In addition to this, Smallrye reactive messaging will retry individual messages on recoverable errors, depending on the `retries` and `delivery.timeout.ms` parameters.

Note that while having retries in a reliable system is a best practice, the `max.in.flights.requests.per.session` parameter defaults to `5`, meaning that the order of the messages is not guaranteed.
If the message order is a must for your use case, setting `max.in.flights.requests.per.session` to `1` will make sure a single batch of messages is sent at a time, in the expense of limiting the throughput of the producer.

For applying retry mechanism on processing errors see the section on <<retrying-processing>>.

=== In-memory channels
In some use cases it is convenient to use the messaging patterns to transfer messages inside the same application.
When you don't connect a channel to a messaging backend like Kafka, everything happens in-memory, and the streams are created by chaining methods altogether.
Each chain is still a reactive stream and enforces the back-pressure protocol.

The framework verifies that the producer/consumer chain is complete,
meaning that if the application writes messages into an in-memory channel (using a method with only `@Outgoing`, or an `Emitter`),
it must also consume the messages from within the application (using a method with only `@Incoming` or using an unmanaged stream).

[[broadcasting-messages-on-multiple-consumers]]
=== Broadcasting messages on multiple consumers

By default, a channel can be linked to a single consumer, using `@Incoming` method or `@Channel` reactive stream.
At application startup, channels are verified to form a chain of consumers and producers with single consumer and producer.
You can override this behavior by setting `mp.messaging.$channel.broadcast=true` on a channel.

In case of in-memory channels, `@Broadcast` annotation can be used on the `@Outgoing` method. For example,

[source, java]
----
import java.util.Random;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;

import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Broadcast;

@ApplicationScoped
public class MultipleConsumer {

    private final Random random = new Random();

    @Outgoing("in-memory-channel")
    @Broadcast
    double generate() {
        return random.nextDouble();
    }

    @Incoming("in-memory-channel")
    void consumeAndLog(double price) {
        System.out.println(price);
    }

    @Incoming("in-memory-channel")
    @Outgoing("prices2")
    double consumeAndSend(double price) {
        return price;
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Reciprocally multiple producers on the same channel can be merged by setting `mp.messaging.incoming.$channel.merge=true`.
On the `@Incoming` methods you can control how multiple channels are merged using `@Merge` annotation.
====

== Processing Messages

Often applications streaming data need to consume some events from a topic, process them and publish the result to a different topic.
A processor method can be simply implemented using both the `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotations:

[source, java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
public class PriceProcessor {

    private static final double CONVERSION_RATE = 0.88;

    @Incoming("price-in")
    @Outgoing("price-out")
    public double process(double price) {
        return price * CONVERSION_RATE;
    }

}
----

The parameter of the `process` method is the incoming message payload, whereas the return will be used as the outgoing messaage payload.
Previously mentioned signatures for parameter and return types, as described in previous sections are supported, such as `Message<T>`, `Record<K, V>` etc.

You can apply asynchronous stream processing by consuming and returning reactive stream `Multi<T>` type:

[source,java]
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;

@ApplicationScoped
public class PriceProcessor {

    private static final double CONVERSION_RATE = 0.88;

    @Incoming("price-in")
    @Outgoing("price-out")
    public Multi<Double> process(Multi<Integer> prices) {
        return prices.filter(p -> p > 100).map(p -> p * CONVERSION_RATE);
    }

}
----

[[kafka-bare-clients]]
== Accessing Kafka clients directly

In rare cases you may need to access the underlying Kafka clients.
`KafkaClientService` provides thread-safe access to `Producer` and `Consumer`.

[source,java]
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;

import io.quarkus.runtime.StartupEvent;
import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaClientService;
import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaConsumer;
import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaProducer;

@ApplicationScoped
public class PriceSender {

    @Inject
    KafkaClientService clientService;

    void onStartup(@Observes StartupEvent startupEvent) {
        KafkaProducer<String, Double> producer = clientService.getProducer("generated-price");
        producer.runOnSendingThread(client -> client.send(new ProducerRecord<>("prices", 2.4)))
            .await().indefinitely();
    }
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `KafkaClientService` is an experimental API and can change in the future.
====

You can also get the Kafka configuration injected to your application and create Kafka producer, consumer and admin clients directly:

[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.common.annotation.Identifier;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClient;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClientConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.KafkaAdminClient;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@ApplicationScoped
public class KafkaClients {

    @Inject
    @Identifier("default-kafka-broker")
    Map<String, Object> config;

    @Produces
    AdminClient getAdmin() {
        Map<String, Object> copy = new HashMap<>();
        for (Map.Entry<String, Object> entry : config.entrySet()) {
            if (AdminClientConfig.configNames().contains(entry.getKey())) {
                copy.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
            }
        }
        return KafkaAdminClient.create(copy);
    }

}

----

This configuration map will contain all Kafka related properties configured inside `application.properties` file.

[[kafka-serialization]]
== JSON serialization

Quarkus has built-in capabilities to deal with JSON Kafka messages.

Imagine we have a `Fruit` pojo as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class Fruit {

    public String name;
    public int price;

    public Fruit() {
    }

    public Fruit(String name, int price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }
}
----

And we want to use it to receive messages from Kafka, make some price transformation, and send messages back to Kafka.

[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Broadcast;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

/**
* A bean consuming data from the "fruit-in" Kafka topic and applying some price conversion.
* The result is pushed to the "fruit-out" stream.
*/
@ApplicationScoped
public class FruitProcessor {

    private static final double CONVERSION_RATE = 0.88;

    @Incoming("fruit-in")
    @Outgoing("fruit-out")
    @Broadcast
    public Fruit process(Fruit fruit) {
        fruit.price = fruit.price * CONVERSION_RATE;
        return fruit;
    }

}
----

To do this, we will need to setup JSON serialization with Jackson or JSON-B.

NOTE: With JSON serialization correctly configured, you can also use `Publisher<Fruit>` and `Emitter<Fruit>`.

[[jackson-serialization]]
=== Serializing via Jackson

First, you need to include the `quarkus-jackson` extension.

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There is an existing `ObjectMapperSerializer` that can be used to serialize all pojos via Jackson.
You may create an empty subclass if you want to use <<serialization-autodetection>>.

The corresponding deserializer class needs to be subclassed.
So, let's create a `FruitDeserializer` that extends the `ObjectMapperDeserializer`.

[source,java]
----
package com.acme.fruit.jackson;

import io.quarkus.kafka.client.serialization.ObjectMapperDeserializer;

public class FruitDeserializer extends ObjectMapperDeserializer<Fruit> {
    public FruitDeserializer() {
        // pass the class to the parent.
        super(Fruit.class);
    }
}
----

Finally, configure your streams to use the Jackson serializer and deserializer.

[source,properties]
----
# Configure the Kafka source (we read from it)
mp.messaging.incoming.fruit-in.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.fruit-in.topic=fruit-in
mp.messaging.incoming.fruit-in.value.deserializer=com.acme.fruit.jackson.FruitDeserializer

# Configure the Kafka sink (we write to it)
mp.messaging.outgoing.fruit-out.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.fruit-out.topic=fruit-out
mp.messaging.outgoing.fruit-out.value.serializer=io.quarkus.kafka.client.serialization.ObjectMapperSerializer
----

Now, your Kafka messages will contain a Jackson serialized representation of your Fruit pojo.
In this case `serializer` and `deserializer` configurations are not necessary as the <<serialization-autodetection>> is enabled by default.

[[jsonb-serialization]]
=== Serializing via JSON-B

First, you need to include the `quarkus-jsonb` extension.

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-jsonb</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There is an existing `JsonbSerializer` that can be used to serialize all pojos via JSON-B.
You may create an empty subclass if you want to use <<serialization-autodetection>>.

The corresponding deserializer class needs to be subclassed.
So, let's create a `FruitDeserializer` that extends the generic `JsonbDeserializer`.

[source,java]
----
package com.acme.fruit.jsonb;

import io.quarkus.kafka.client.serialization.JsonbDeserializer;

public class FruitDeserializer extends JsonbDeserializer<Fruit> {
    public FruitDeserializer() {
        // pass the class to the parent.
        super(Fruit.class);
    }
}
----

Finally, configure your streams to use the JSON-B serializer and deserializer.

[source,properties]
----
# Configure the Kafka source (we read from it)
mp.messaging.incoming.fruit-in.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.fruit-in.topic=fruit-in
mp.messaging.incoming.fruit-in.value.deserializer=com.acme.fruit.jsonb.FruitDeserializer

# Configure the Kafka sink (we write to it)
mp.messaging.outgoing.fruit-out.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.fruit-out.topic=fruit-out
mp.messaging.outgoing.fruit-out.value.serializer=io.quarkus.kafka.client.serialization.JsonbSerializer
----

Now, your Kafka messages will contain a JSON-B serialized representation of your Fruit pojo.

NOTE: If you don't want to create a deserializer for each of your pojo, you can use the generic `io.vertx.kafka.client.serialization.JsonObjectDeserializer`
that will deserialize to a `io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject`. The corresponding serializer can also be used: `io.vertx.kafka.client.serialization.JsonObjectSerializer`.

== Avro Serialization

This is described in a dedicated guide: link:kafka-schema-registry-avro[Using Apache Kafka with Schema Registry and Avro].

[[serialization-autodetection]]
== Serializer/deserializer autodetection

When using SmallRye Reactive Messaging with Kafka, Quarkus can often automatically detect the correct serializer and deserializer class.
This autodetection is based on declarations of `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` methods, as well as injected ``@Channel``s.

For example, if you declare

[source,java]
----
@Outgoing("generated-price")
public Multi<Integer> generate() {
    ...
}
----

and your configuration indicates that the `generated-price` channel uses the `smallrye-kafka` connector, then Quarkus will automatically set the `value.serializer` to Kafka's built-in `IntegerSerializer`.

Similarly, if you declare

[source,java]
----
@Incoming("my-kafka-records")
public void consume(KafkaRecord<Long, byte[]> record) {
    ...
}
----

and your configuration indicates that the `my-kafka-records` channel uses the `smallrye-kafka` connector, then Quarkus will automatically set the `key.deserializer` to Kafka's built-in `LongDeserializer`, as well as the `value.deserializer` to `ByteArrayDeserializer`.

Finally, if you declare

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Channel("price-create")
Emitter<Double> priceEmitter;
----

and your configuration indicates that the `price-create` channel uses the `smallrye-kafka` connector, then Quarkus will automatically set the `value.serializer` to Kafka's built-in `DoubleSerializer`.

The full set of types supported by the serializer/deserializer autodetection is:

* `short` and `java.lang.Short`
* `int` and `java.lang.Integer`
* `long` and `java.lang.Long`
* `float` and `java.lang.Float`
* `double` and `java.lang.Double`
* `byte[]`
* `java.lang.String`
* `java.util.UUID`
* `java.nio.ByteBuffer`
* `org.apache.kafka.common.utils.Bytes`
* `io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer`
* `io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject`
* `io.vertx.core.json.JsonArray`
* classes generated from Avro schemas, if Confluent or Apicurio _serde_ is present
** see link:kafka-schema-registry-avro[Using Apache Kafka with Schema Registry and Avro] for more information about using Confluent or Apicurio libraries
* classes for which a subclass of `ObjectMapperSerializer` / `ObjectMapperDeserializer` is present, as described in <<jackson-serialization>>
** it is technically not needed to subclass `ObjectMapperSerializer`, but in such case, autodetection isn't possible
* classes for which a subclass of `JsonbSerializer` / `JsonbDeserializer` is present, as described in <<jsonb-serialization>>
** it is technically not needed to subclass `JsonbSerializer`, but in such case, autodetection isn't possible

In case you have any issues with serializer autodetection, you can switch it off completely by setting `quarkus.reactive-messaging.kafka.serializer-autodetection.enabled=false`.
If a serializer/deserializer is set by configuration it won't be replaced by the autodetection.
If you find you need to do this, please file a bug in the link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues[Quarkus issue tracker] so we can fix whatever problem you have.

== Using Schema Registry

This is described in a dedicated guide: link:kafka-schema-registry-avro[Using Apache Kafka with Schema Registry and Avro].

[[kafka-health-check]]
== Health Checks

Quarkus provides several health checks for Kafka.
These checks are used in combination with the `quarkus-smallrye-health` extension.

When using the `quarkus-kafka` extension, you can enable _readiness_ health check by setting the `quarkus.kafka.health.enabled` property to `true` in your `application.properties`.
This check reports the status of the interaction with a _default_ Kafka broker (configured using `kafka.bootstrap.servers`).
That check requires an _admin connection_ with the Kafka broker.
This check is disabled by default.
If enabled, when you access the `/q/health/ready` endpoint of your application, you will have information about the connection validation status.

When using Reactive Messaging and the Kafka connector, each configured channel (incoming or outgoing) provides a _liveness_ and _readiness_ check.
The _liveness_ check captures any unrecoverable failure happening during the communication with Kafka.
The _readiness_ check verifies that communication with Kafka is established.
For each channel, you can disable the checks using:

[source, properties]
----
# Disable both liveness and readiness checks with `health-enabled=false`:

# Incoming channel (receiving records form Kafka)
mp.messaging.incoming.your-channel.health-enabled=false
# Outgoing channel (writing records to Kafka)
mp.messaging.outgoing.your-channel.health-enabled=false

# Disable only the readiness check with `health-readiness-enabled=false`:

mp.messaging.incoming.your-channel.health-readiness-enabled=false
mp.messaging.outgoing.your-channel.health-readiness-enabled=false
----

NOTE: You can configure the `bootstrap.servers` for each channel using `mp.messaging.incoming|outgoing.$channel.bootstrap.servers` property.
Defaults is `kafka.bootstrap.servers`.

Reactive Messaging readiness check offers two strategies.
The default strategy verifies that an active connection is established with the broker.
This approach is not intrusive as it's based on built-in metrics.

Using the `health-readiness-topic-verification=true` attribute, you can also check the topics used by the application exist in the broker.
Note that, to achieve this, an _admin connection_ is required.

== Kafka Streams

This is described in a dedicated guide: link:kafka-streams[Using Apache Kafka Streams].

== Using Snappy for message compression

On _outgoing_ channels, you can enable Snappy compression by setting the `compression.type` attribute to `snappy`:

[source, properties]
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.fruit-out.compression.type=snappy
----

In JVM mode, it will work out of the box.
However, to compile your application to a native executable, you need to:

1. Uses GraalVM 21.+
2. Add `quarkus.kafka.snappy.enabled=true` to your `application.properties`

In native mode, Snappy is disabled by default as the use of Snappy requires embedding a native library and unpacking it when the application starts.

== Authentication with OAuth

If your Kafka broker uses OAuth as authentication mechanism, you need to configure the Kafka consumer to enable this authentication process.
First, add the following dependency to your application:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.strimzi</groupId>
    <artifactId>kafka-oauth-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This dependency provides the callback handler required to handle the OAuth workflow.
Then, in the `application.properties`, add:

[source, properties]
----
mp.messaging.connector.smallrye-kafka.security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT
mp.messaging.connector.smallrye-kafka.sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER
mp.messaging.connector.smallrye-kafka.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required \
  oauth.client.id="team-a-client" \
  oauth.client.secret="team-a-client-secret" \
  oauth.token.endpoint.uri="http://keycloak:8080/auth/realms/kafka-authz/protocol/openid-connect/token" ;
mp.messaging.connector.smallrye-kafka.sasl.login.callback.handler.class=io.strimzi.kafka.oauth.client.JaasClientOauthLoginCallbackHandler
----

Update the `oauth.client.id`, `oauth.client.secret` and `oauth.token.endpoint.uri` values.

OAuth authentication works for both JVM and native modes.

== Testing a Kafka application

=== Testing without a broker

It can be useful to test the application without having to start a Kafka broker.
To achieve this, you can _switch_ the channels managed by the Kafka connector to _in-memory_.

IMPORTANT: This approach only works for JVM tests. It cannot be used for native tests (because they do not support injection).

First, add the following dependency to your application:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
    <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-in-memory</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Then, create a Quarkus Test Resource as follows:

[source, java]
----
public class KafkaTestResourceLifecycleManager implements QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager {

    @Override
    public Map<String, String> start() {
        Map<String, String> env = new HashMap<>();
        Map<String, String> props1 = InMemoryConnector.switchIncomingChannelsToInMemory("orders");  // <1>
        Map<String, String> props2 = InMemoryConnector.switchOutgoingChannelsToInMemory("queue");   // <2>
        env.putAll(props1);
        env.putAll(props2);
        return env;  // <3>
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        InMemoryConnector.clear();  // <4>
    }
}
----
1. Switch the incoming channel "orders" (expecting messages from Kafka) to in-memory.
2. Switch the outgoing channel "queue" (writing messages to Kafka) to in-memory.
3. Builds and returns a `Map` containing all the properties required to configure the application to use in-memory channels.
4. When the test stops, clear the `InMemoryConnector` (discard all the received and sent messages)

Create a Quarkus Test using the test resource created above:

[source, java]
----
@QuarkusTest
@QuarkusTestResource(KafkaTestResourceLifecycleManager.class)
class BaristaTest {

    @Inject @Any
    InMemoryConnector connector; // <1>

    @Test
    void testProcessOrder() {
        InMemorySource<Order> orders = connector.source("orders"); // <2>
        InMemorySink<Beverage> queue = connector.sink("queue");    // <3>

        Order order = new Order();
        order.setProduct("coffee");
        order.setName("Coffee lover");
        order.setOrderId("1234");

        orders.send(order);  // <4>

        await().<List<? extends Message<Beverage>>>until(queue::received, t -> t.size() == 1); // <5>

        Beverage queuedBeverage = queue.received().get(0).getPayload();
        Assertions.assertEquals(Beverage.State.READY, queuedBeverage.getPreparationState());
        Assertions.assertEquals("coffee", queuedBeverage.getBeverage());
        Assertions.assertEquals("Coffee lover", queuedBeverage.getCustomer());
        Assertions.assertEquals("1234", queuedBeverage.getOrderId());
    }

}
----
1. Inject the in-memory connector in your test class.
2. Retrieve the incoming channel (`orders`) - the channel must have been switched to in-memory in the test resource.
3. Retrieve the outgoing channel (`queue`) - the channel must have been switched to in-memory in the test resource.
4. Use the `send` method to send a message to the `orders` channel. So, the application will process this message.
5. Use the `received` method to check the messages produced by the application.

=== Starting Kafka in a test resource

Alternatively, you can start a Kafka broker in a test resource.
The following snippet shows a test resource starting a Kafka broker using https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/kafka/[Testcontainers]:

[source, java]
----
public class KafkaResource implements QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager {

    private final KafkaContainer kafka = new KafkaContainer();

    @Override
    public Map<String, String> start() {
        kafka.start();
        return Collections.singletonMap("kafka.bootstrap.servers", kafka.getBootstrapServers());  // <1>

== Kubernetes Service Bindings

Quarkus Kafka extension supports
link:deploying-to-kubernetes[Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes].
You can enable this by adding the `quarkus-kubernetes-service-binding` extension to your application.

When running in appropriately configured Kubernetes clusters, Kafka extension will pull its Kafka broker connection configuration from the service binding available inside the cluster, without the need for user configuration.

== Configuration Reference

More details about the SmallRye Reactive Messaging configuration can be found in the https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/smallrye-reactive-messaging/2.8/kafka/kafka.html[SmallRye Reactive Messaging - Kafka Connector Documentation].
The most important attributes are listed in the tables below:

=== Incoming channel configuration (polling from Kafka)

The following attributes are configured using:

[source, properties]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.your-channel-name.attribute=value
----

Some properties have aliases which can be configured globally:

[source, properties]
----
kafka.bootstrap.servers=...

.Incoming Attributes of the 'smallrye-kafka' connector
[cols="25, 30, 15, 20",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute (_alias_) | Description | Mandatory | Default

| *bootstrap.servers*

_(kafka.bootstrap.servers)_ | A comma-separated list of host:port to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.

Type: _string_ | false | `localhost:9092`

| *topic* | The consumed / populated Kafka topic. If neither this property nor the `topics` properties are set, the channel name is used

Type: _string_ | false |

| *health-enabled* | Whether health reporting is enabled (default) or disabled

Type: _boolean_ | false | `true`

| *health-readiness-enabled* | Whether readiness health reporting is enabled (default) or disabled

Type: _boolean_ | false | `true`

| *health-readiness-topic-verification* | Whether the readiness check should verify that topics exist on the broker. Default to false. Enabling it requires an admin connection.

Type: _boolean_ | false | `false`

| *health-readiness-timeout* | During the readiness health check, the connector connects to the broker and retrieves the list of topics. This attribute specifies the maximum duration (in ms) for the retrieval. If exceeded, the channel is considered not-ready.

Type: _long_ | false | `2000`

| *tracing-enabled* | Whether tracing is enabled (default) or disabled

Type: _boolean_ | false | `true`

| *cloud-events* | Enables (default) or disables the Cloud Event support. If enabled on an _incoming_ channel, the connector analyzes the incoming records and try to create Cloud Event metadata. If enabled on an _outgoing_, the connector sends the outgoing messages as Cloud Event if the message includes Cloud Event Metadata.

Type: _boolean_ | false | `true`

| *topics* | A comma-separating list of topics to be consumed. Cannot be used with the `topic` or `pattern` properties

Type: _string_ | false |

| *pattern* | Indicate that the `topic` property is a regular expression. Must be used with the `topic` property. Cannot be used with the `topics` property

Type: _boolean_ | false | `false`

Type: _string_ | false | `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer`

| *value.deserializer* | The deserializer classname used to deserialize the record's value

Type: _string_ | true |

| *fetch.min.bytes* | The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive.

Type: _int_ | false | `1`

| *group.id* | A unique string that identifies the consumer group the application belongs to.

If not set, defaults to the application name as set by the `quarkus.application.name` configuration property.

If that is not set either, a unique, generated id is used.
It is recommended to always define a `group.id`, the automatic generation is only a convenient feature for development.

Type: _string_ | false |

| *enable.auto.commit* | If enabled, consumer's offset will be periodically committed in the background by the underlying Kafka client, ignoring the actual processing outcome of the records. It is recommended to NOT enable this setting and let Reactive Messaging handles the commit.

Type: _string_ | false |

| *throttled.unprocessed-record-max-age.ms* | While using the `throttled` commit-strategy, specify the max age in milliseconds that an unprocessed message can be before the connector is marked as unhealthy.

Type: _int_ | false | `60000`

| *dead-letter-queue.topic* | When the `failure-strategy` is set to `dead-letter-queue` indicates on which topic the record is sent. Defaults is `dead-letter-topic-$channel`

Type: _string_ | false |

| *dead-letter-queue.key.serializer* | When the `failure-strategy` is set to `dead-letter-queue` indicates the key serializer to use. If not set the serializer associated to the key deserializer is used

Type: _string_ | false |

| *dead-letter-queue.value.serializer* | When the `failure-strategy` is set to `dead-letter-queue` indicates the value serializer to use. If not set the serializer associated to the value deserializer is used

If set, deserialization failure happening when deserializing keys are delegated to this handler which may provide a fallback value.

Type: _string_ | false |

| *value-deserialization-failure-handler* | The name set in `javax.inject.Named` of a bean that implements `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.DeserializationFailureHandler`. If set, deserialization failure happening when deserializing values are delegated to this handler which may provide a fallback value.

Type: _string_ | false |

| *graceful-shutdown* | Whether or not a graceful shutdown should be attempted when the application terminates.

Type: _boolean_ | false | `true`
