The {product-name-first} Security architecture provides several built-in authentication mechanisms and is highly customizable.
The primary mechanism for securing HTTP applications in {product-name} is the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface.

== Overview of the Quarkus Security architecture

When a client sends an HTTP request, {product-name} Security orchestrates security authentication and authorization by interacting with several built-in core components including `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`, `IdentityProvider`, and `SecurityIdentityAugmentor`.

The sequential security validation process results in one of three outcomes:

* The HTTP request gets authenticated and authorized and access to the {product-name} application gets granted.
* The HTTP request authentication fails and the requester receives a challenge specific to the authentication mechanism, for example, a `401` error, a URL redirect to reauthenticate, or some other custom authentication challenge response.
For some practical examples of challenge responses, see the {product-name} xref:security-customization.adoc[Security Tips and Tricks] guide.
* The HTTP request authorization fails and the requester gets denied access to the {product-name} application.

The following diagram steps through the detailed process flow of the {product-name} Security architecture:

== Core components of the Quarkus Security architecture

=== `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`
{product-name} Security uses `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` to extract the authentication credentials from the HTTP request and delegates them to `IdentityProvider` to convert the credentials to `SecurityIdentity`.
For example, the credentials can come from the `Authorization` header, client HTTPS certificates, or cookies.

When an authentication request is rejected by {product-name} Security, `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` sends an authentication challenge back to the client.
The type of challenge depends on the authentication mechanism.
For example, with the OIDC OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authorization Code Flow mechanism, a redirect URL gets generated and the client is sent back to the OpenID Connect provider to authenticate.

=== `IdentityProvider`
`IdentityProvider` verifies the authentication credentials and maps them to `SecurityIdentity`, which has the username, roles, original authentication credentials, and other attributes.

You can inject a `SecurityIdentity` instance for every authenticated resource to get the authenticated identity information.

In other contexts, it is possible to have other parallel representations of the same information or parts of it, for example, `SecurityContext` for Jakarta REST or `JsonWebToken` for JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

For more information, see the {product-name} xref:security-identity-providers.adoc[Identity providers] guide.

=== `SecurityIdentityAugmentor`
Because {product-name} Security is customizable, for example, you can add authorization roles to `SecurityIdentity`, you can register and prioritize one or more custom security augmentors.

Registered instances of `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` are invoked during the final stage of the security authentication process.
For more information, see the xref:security-customization.adoc#security-identity-customization[Security Identity Customization] section of the "Security Tips and Tricks" guide.


== Supported authentication mechanisms

To learn more about security authentication in {product-name} and the supported mechanisms and protocols, see the {product-name} xref:security-authentication-mechanisms.adoc[Authentication mechanisms in {product-name}] guide.

== Proactive authentication

Proactive authentication is enabled in {product-name} by default.
The request is always authenticated if an incoming request has a credential, even if the target page does not require authentication.
For more information, see the {product-name} xref:security-proactive-authentication.adoc[Proactive authentication] guide.

== Quarkus Security customization

{product-name} Security is also highly customizable.
You can customize the following core security components of {product-name}:

* `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`
* `IdentityProvider`
* `SecurityidentityAugmentor`

For more information about customizing {product-name} Security, including reactive security and how to register a security provider, see the {product-name} link:{url-quarkusio-guides}security-customization[Security tips and tricks] guide.
