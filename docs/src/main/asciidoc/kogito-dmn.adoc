= Using Kogito DMN support to add decision automation capabilities to an application
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: business-automation
:summary: Use Kogito to add business automation and power it up with DMN decision support.

This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can use Kogito to add business automation
and power it up with DMN decision support.

Kogito is a next generation business automation toolkit that originates from well known Open Source projects
Drools (for business rules) and jBPM (for business processes). Kogito aims at providing a newer approach
to business automation where the main message is to expose your business knowledge (processes, rules, decisions, predictions)
in a domain specific way.

== Prerequisites

:prerequisites-docker:
:prerequisites-ide: (VSCode is preferred, with the Red Hat DMN Editor VSCode Extension)
include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]

=== DMN Editor

Kogito Tooling is currently supported via VSCode, web browsers and on other platforms:

VSCode::

    Download and install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-extension-dmn-editor[Red Hat DMN Editor VSCode Extension] to edit and model process definitions from VSCode IDE.

Online::

    To avoid any modeler installation you can use directly use https://dmn.new[DMN.new] to author your DMN model through your favorite web browser.

Other platforms::

    You can reference to https://kiegroup.github.io/kogito-online/#/download[Business Modeler Hub] to download the latest platforms supported for the https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases[Kogito tooling releases].

== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple microservice which offers one REST endpoint:

* `/pricing`

This endpoint will be automatically generated based on the defined DMN model.

=== Decision rules as a DMN model

A DMN model is an open standard for visual and semantic execution of declarative logic; DMN allows you to externalise decision logic into reusable pieces that can be easily used in declarative way. There are multiple ways of writing rules other than DMN, like: decision tables, decision trees, rules, etc.

For this example we focus on using the https://drools.org/learn/dmn.html[DMN (Decision Model and Notation)] open standard to describe the decision rules.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the complete example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `kogito-dmn-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/kogito-dmn-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

:create-app-artifact-id: kogito-dmn-quickstart
:create-app-extensions: dmn,resteasy-reactive-jackson
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

This command generates a Maven project, importing the `kogito-quarkus-decisions` extension
that comes with all needed dependencies and configuration to equip your application
with business automation.
It also imports the `resteasy-reactive-jackson` extension that is needed for Kogito to expose REST services.

The `kogito-quarkus-decisions` is a specialized extension of the Kogito project focusing only on DMN support; if you want to 
make use of the full capabilities offered by the Kogito platform, you can reference the generic Kogito extension of Quarkus.

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `kogito-quarkus-decisions` extension
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

:add-extension-extensions: dmn
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

or alternatively:

:add-extension-extensions: kogito-quarkus-decisions
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

This will add the following to your build file:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
    <artifactId>kogito-quarkus-decisions</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("org.kie.kogito:kogito-quarkus-decisions")
----

== Authoring the DMN model

We will author a DMN model that will provide a base price quotation based on some criteria.
Create a new file `pricing.dmn` inside the `src/main/resources/` directory of the generated project.

This model should consist of:

* `Age` (InputData element, of type `number`)
* `Previous incidents?` (InputData element, of type `boolean`)
* `Base price` (Decision element, of type `number`)

And the Decision Requirement Graph (DRG) should look like:

image:kogito-DMN-guide-screenshot-DRG.png[alt=DMN model definition]

To get started quickly you may copy the DMN model definition file from the
{quickstarts-tree-url}/kogito-dmn-quickstart/src/main/resources/pricing.dmn[quickstart]

The decision logic for the `Base price` Decision node shall be a DMN Decision Table with the following entries:

image:kogito-DMN-guide-screenshot-DT.png[alt=DMN Decision Table definition]

To author the DMN model yourself, just follow these steps:

* drag an InputData node from the palette, name it `Age` and assign it the type `number` using the Properties panel.
* drag an InputData node from the palette, name it `Previous incidents?` and assign it the type `boolean` using the Properties panel.
* drag a Decision node from the palette, name it `Base price` and assign it the type `number` using the Properties panel.
* establish an `InformationRequirement` edge from `Age` to `Base price` nodes, by using the node palette by mouse overing near the element in the graph.
* establish an `InformationRequirement` edge from `Previous incidents?` to `Base price` nodes, by using the node palette by mouse overing near the element in the graph.
* select the Edit decision logic option for the node `Base price`.
** select Decision Table as the decision logic for the node.
** create the relevant rules (rows) entries as per the above screenshot.
* save the file

For more information about DMN, you can reference the Kogito documentation at the links below.

== Running and Using the Application

=== Running in Dev Mode

To run the microservice in dev mode, use:

include::{includes}/devtools/dev.adoc[]

=== Running in JVM Mode

When you're done playing with dev mode, you can run it as a standard Java application.

First compile it:

include::{includes}/devtools/build.adoc[]

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

=== Running in Native Mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code: no modifications required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your
production environment, as the runtime technology is included in
the produced binary, and optimized to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compilation will take a bit longer, so this step is disabled by default;
let's build a native executable with the following command:

include::{includes}/devtools/build-native.adoc[]

Native compilation will always take some time to complete; then, you'll be able to run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/kogito-dmn-quickstart-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----

== Testing the Application

To test your final decision service application, just send a request to the endpoint by supplying as JSON
payload the expected inputs:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/pricing' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{ "Age": 47, "Previous incidents?": false }'
----

In the response, the `Base price` will be quoted -accordingly to the defined DMN model- for a total amount of `500`; this is visible in the response payload:

[source,JSON]
----
{"Previous incidents?":false,"Age":47,"Base price":500}
----

== Using Test Scenario tool

Kogito allows to define visually test scenarios, and execute them as JUnit tests as part of the normal build of the Quarkus application.

To be able to use Test Scenario assets in your application, an additional dependency is required:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
    <artifactId>kogito-scenario-simulation</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
testImplementation("org.kie.kogito:kogito-scenario-simulation")
----

You can now create a `KogitoScenarioJunitActivatorTest.java` class file in the `src/test/java/testscenario` directory:
[source,java]
----
package testscenario;
@org.junit.runner.RunWith(org.kogito.scenariosimulation.runner.KogitoJunitActivator.class)
public class KogitoScenarioJunitActivatorTest {
}
----

This activator class is a custom JUnit runner that enables the execution of test scenario files in your application.

You can now create a `PricingTest.scesim` file in the `src/test/resources` directory:

image:kogito-DMN-guide-screenshot-scesim.png[alt=DMN Test scenario]

The test scenarios will be run as part of the JUnit test suite.

For more information about the Test Scenario tool, you can reference the Kogito documentation at the links below.

== Where to go from here

This was a minimal example using a DMN modeling; as you can see the Kogito framework allow to quickly define a decision logic using a visual and standard notation, such as DMN, and create a fully functioning microservice on top of Quarkus!

To see additional capabilities of the Kogito platform, you can reference the Kogito documentation at the links below.
This includes more detailed guides about integrating with Processes (BPMN2), Rules (Drools' DRL), Prediction (PMML), Test Scenario (visual notation for testing), assisted deployment to OpenShift, and many more.
