/**
 * Annotation that indicates that this test should be run using a native image,
 * rather than in the JVM. This must also be combined with {@link QuarkusTestExtension}.
 *
 * The standard usage pattern is expected to be a base test class that runs the
 * tests using the JVM version of Quarkus, with a subclass that extends the base
 * test and is annotated with this annotation to perform the same checks against
 * the native image.
 *
 * Note that it is not possible to mix JVM and native image tests in the same test
 * run, it is expected that the JVM tests will be standard unit tests that are
 * executed by surefire, while the native image tests will be integration tests
 * executed by failsafe.
