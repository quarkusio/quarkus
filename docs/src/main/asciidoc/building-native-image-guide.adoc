= {project-name} - Building a Native Image

This guide covers:

* Compiling the application to a native executable
* The packaging of the application in a Docker container

This guide takes as input the application developed in the link:getting-started-guide.html[Getting Started Guide].

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* GraalVM installed from the http://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[GraalVM web site].
Using the community edition is enough.
At least version {graal-version} is required.
* The `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* A running Docker
* The code of the application developed in the link:getting-started-guide.adoc[Getting Started Guide].

[NOTE]
====
Once you have downloaded GraalVM, expand the archive and set the `GRAALVM_HOME` variable to this location:

`export GRAALVM_HOME=~clement/Development/graalvm/`

On MacOS, point the variable to the `Home` sub-directory:

`export GRAALVM_HOME=~clement/Development/graalvm/Contents/Home/`
====

Remember, you need to configure Maven as indicated in the link:maven-config.html[Maven configuration page].

== Solution

We recommend you to follow the instructions in the next sections and package the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone https://github.com/jbossas/quarkus-quickstarts.git`, or download an https://github.com/jbossas/quarkus-quickstarts/archive/master.zip[archive].

The solution is located in the `getting-started-native` directory.

== Producing a native executable

Let's now produce a native executable for our application.
It improves the startup time of the application, and produces a minimal disk footprint.
The executable would have everything to run the application including the "JVM" (shrunk to be just enough to run the application), and the application.

Before going further, be sure that the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable is configured appropriately.

If you have generated the application from the previous tutorial, you can find in the `pom.xml` the following _profile_:

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>native</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
                    <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>${quarkus.version}</version>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>native-image</goal>
                            </goals>
                            <configuration>
                                <enableHttpUrlHandler>true</enableHttpUrlHandler>
                            </configuration>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>
----

We use a profile because, you will see very soon, packaging the native image takes a _few_ seconds.

Create a native executable using: `mvn package -Pnative`.

In addition to the regular files, the build also produces `target/quarkus-quickstart-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.
You can run it using: `target/quarkus-quickstart-native-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.

== Testing the native executable

Producing a native executable can lead to a few issues, and so it's also a good idea to run some tests against the application running in the native file.

In the `pom.xml` file, extend the `native` profile with:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${surefire.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>integration-test</goal>
                <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <systemProperties>
                    <native.image.path>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}-runner</native.image.path>
                </systemProperties>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

Then, create the `src/test/java/org/acme/quickstart/GreetingResourceIT.java` with the following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.quickstart;


import io.quarkus.test.junit.SubstrateTest;

@SubstrateTest // <1>
public class GreetingResourceIT extends GreetingResourceTest { // <2>

    // Run the same tests

}
----
<1> Use another test runner that starts the application from the native file before the tests.
The executable is retrieved using the `native.image.path` system property configured in the _Failsafe Maven Plugin_.
<2> We extend our previous tests, but you can also implement your tests

To see the `GreetingResourceIT` run against the native image, add a verify goal:
[source]

mvn package verify -Pnative

== Producing a Docker container

IMPORTANT: Before going further, be sure to have a working Docker environment.

You can run the application in a Docker container using the JAR produced by the Quarkus Maven Plugin.
However, in this guide we focus on creating a Docker image using the produced native executable.
Because the Docker container may not use the same _executable_ format as the one produced by default, we must instruct the Maven build to produce an
 executable from inside a Docker container:

[source, bash]
----
mvn package -Pnative -Dnative-image.docker-build=true
----

The produced executable will be a 64 bit Linux executable, so depending on your operating system it may no longer be runnable.
However, it's not an issue as we are going to copy it to a Docker container.
The project generation has provided a `Dockerfile` in the `src/main/docker` directory with the following content:

[source]
----
FROM registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY target/*-runner /work/application
RUN chmod 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

Then, if you didn't delete the generated native executable, you can build the docker image with:

[source]
----
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile -t quarkus-quickstart/quickstart .
----

And finally, run it with:

[source]
----
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus-quickstart/quickstart
----

NOTE: Interested by tiny Docker images, check the https://github.com/jbossas/quarkus/tree/master/docker/distroless[distroless] version.

== What's next?

This guide covered the creation of a native (binary) executable for your application.
It provides an application exhibiting a swift startup time and consuming less memory.
However, there is much more.
We recommend continuing the journey with the link:kubernetes-guide.html[deployment to Kubernetes and OpenShift].
