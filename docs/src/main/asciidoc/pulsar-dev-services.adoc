= Dev Services for Pulsar

With Quarkus Smallrye Reactive Messaging Pulsar extension (`quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-pulsar`)
Dev Services for Pulsar automatically starts a Pulsar broker in dev mode and when running tests.
So, you don't have to start a broker manually.
The application is configured automatically.

== Enabling / Disabling Dev Services for Pulsar

Dev Services for Pulsar is automatically enabled unless:

- `quarkus.pulsar.devservices.enabled` is set to `false`
- the `pulsar.client.serviceUrl` is configured
- all the Reactive Messaging Pulsar channels have the `serviceUrl` attribute set

Dev Services for Pulsar relies on Docker to start the broker.
If your environment does not support Docker, you will need to start the broker manually, or connect to an already running broker.
You can configure the broker address using `pulsar.client.`.

== Shared broker

Most of the time you need to share the broker between applications.
Dev Services for Pulsar implements a _service discovery_ mechanism for your multiple Quarkus applications running in _dev_ mode to share a single broker.

NOTE: Dev Services for Pulsar starts the container with the `quarkus-dev-service-pulsar` label which is used to identify the container.

If you need multiple (shared) brokers, you can configure the `quarkus.pulsar.devservices.service-name` attribute and indicate the broker name.
It looks for a container with the same value, or starts a new one if none can be found.
The default service name is `pulsar`.

Sharing is enabled by default in dev mode, but disabled in test mode.
You can disable the sharing with `quarkus.pulsar.devservices.shared=false`.

== Setting the port

By default, Dev Services for Pulsar picks a random port and configures the application.
You can set the port by configuring the `quarkus.pulsar.devservices.port` property.

Note that the Pulsar advertised address is automatically configured with the chosen port.

[[configuring-the-image]]
== Configuring the image

Dev Services for Pulsar supports the https://hub.docker.com/r/apachepulsar/pulsar[official Apache Pulsar image].

A custom image name can be configured as such:
[source, properties]
----
quarkus.pulsar.devservices.image-name=datastax/lunastreaming-all:2.10_4.7
----

== Configuring the Pulsar broker

You can configure the Dev Services for Pulsar with custom broker configuration.

The following example enables transaction support:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.pulsar.devservices.broker-config.transactionCoordinatorEnabled=true
quarkus.pulsar.devservices.broker-config.systemTopicEnabled=true
----
