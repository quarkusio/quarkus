# Maven Analyzer Error Handling Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Removed try-catch block** from `createNodesV2` function in `maven-plugin.ts:69-118`
   - Previously, all Maven analysis errors were caught and an empty array was returned
   - Now errors properly propagate up to fail the project graph creation

2. **Simplified analyzer check** in `runMavenAnalysis` function in `maven-plugin.ts:183-186`
   - Removed the NODE_ENV test condition check
   - Now always validates that the Maven analyzer is present before attempting analysis

## How It Works

When the Maven analyzer is missing:
1. `findJavaAnalyzer()` returns `null` (line 184)
2. The error "Maven analyzer not found. Please ensure maven-plugin is compiled." is thrown
3. This error now propagates through `createNodesV2` and fails the entire project graph creation
4. Users will see a clear error message about the missing analyzer

## Testing

- Verified that with analyzer present, project graph creation works normally
- Tested with analyzer removed - the system properly fails with the expected error message
- The error message clearly indicates that the maven-plugin needs to be compiled

## Result

The project graph creation now properly fails when the Maven analyzer is missing, providing clear feedback to users about what needs to be fixed.
