:summary: Learn more about the Scheduler extension.
:numbered:
:sectnums:
:sectnumlevels: 4

Modern applications often need to run specific tasks periodically.
There are two scheduler extensions in Quarkus.
The `quarkus-scheduler` extension brings the API and a lightweight in-memory scheduler implementation.
The `quarkus-quartz` extension implements the API from the `quarkus-scheduler` extension and contains a scheduler implementation based on the Quartz library.
You will only need `quarkus-quartz` for more advanced scheduling use cases, such as persistent tasks, clustering and programmatic scheduling of jobs.

NOTE: If you add the `quarkus-quartz` dependency to your project the lightweight scheduler implementation from the `quarkus-scheduler` extension is automatically disabled. 

== Scheduled Methods

A method annotated with `@io.quarkus.scheduler.Scheduled` is automatically scheduled for invocation.
A scheduled method must not be abstract or private.
It may be either static or non-static.
A scheduled method can be annotated with interceptor bindings, such as `@javax.transaction.Transactional` and `@org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation.Counted`.

NOTE: If there is a bean class that has no scope and declares at least one non-static method annotated with `@Scheduled` then `@Singleton` is used.

Furthermore, the annotated method must return `void` and either declare no parameters or one parameter of type `io.quarkus.scheduler.ScheduledExecution`.

TIP: The annotation is repeatable so a single method could be scheduled multiple times.

[WARNING]
====
Subclasses never inherit the metadata of a `@Scheduled` method declared on a superclass. In the following example, the `everySecond()` method is only invoked upon the instance of `Jobs`.
[source,java]
----
class Jobs {

   @Scheduled(every = "1s")
   void everySecond() {
     // ..do something 
   }
}

@Singleton
class MyJobs extends Jobs {
}
----
====

A CDI event of type `io.quarkus.scheduler.SuccessfulExecution` is fired synchronously and asynchronously when an execution of a scheduled method is successful. A CDI event of type `io.quarkus.scheduler.FailedExecution` is fired synchronously and asynchronously  when an execution of a scheduled method throws an exception.

=== Triggers

A trigger is defined either by the `@Scheduled#cron()` or by the `@Scheduled#every()` attribute.
If both are specified, the cron expression takes precedence.
If none is specified, the build fails with an `IllegalStateException`.

==== CRON

A CRON trigger is defined by a cron-like expression.
For example `"0 15 10 * * ?"` fires at 10:15am every day.

.CRON Trigger Example
[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(cron = "0 15 10 * * ?")
void fireAt10AmEveryDay() { }
----

The syntax used in CRON expressions is controlled by the `quarkus.scheduler.cron-type` property.
The values can be `cron4j`, `quartz`, `unix` and `spring`.
`quartz` is used by default.

The `cron` attribute supports <<config-reference#property-expressions,Property Expressions>> including default values and nested
Property Expressions. (Note that "{property.path}" style expressions are still supported but don't offer the full functionality of Property Expressions.)


.CRON Config Property Example
[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(cron = "${myMethod.cron.expr}")
void myMethod() { }
----

If you wish to disable a specific scheduled method, you can set its cron expression to `"off"` or `"disabled"`.

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
myMethod.cron.expr=disabled
----

Property Expressions allow you to define a default value that is used, if the property is not configured.

.CRON Config Property Example with default `0 0 15 ? * MON *`
[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(cron = "${myMethod.cron.expr:0 0 15 ? * MON *}")
void myMethod() { }
----

If the property `myMethod.cron.expr` is undefined or `null`, the default value (`0 0 15 ? * MON *`) will be used.

==== Intervals

An interval trigger defines a period between invocations.
The period expression is based on the ISO-8601 duration format `PnDTnHnMn.nS` and the value of `@Scheduled#every()` is parsed with `java.time.Duration#parse(CharSequence)`. 
However, if an expression starts with a digit then the `PT` prefix is added automatically.
So for example, `15m` can be used instead of `PT15M` and is parsed as "15 minutes".

.Interval Trigger Example
[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(every = "15m")
void every15Mins() { }
----

The `every` attribute supports <<config-reference#property-expressions,Property Expressions>> including default values and nested
Property Expressions. (Note that `"{property.path}"` style expressions are still supported but don't offer the full functionality of Property Expressions.)

.Interval Config Property Example
[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(every = "${myMethod.every.expr}")
void myMethod() { }
----

Intervals can be disabled by setting their value to `"off"` or `"disabled"`.
So for example a Property Expression with the default value `"off"` can be used to disable the trigger if its Config Property has not been set.

.Interval Config Property Example with a Default Value
[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(every = "${myMethod.every.expr:off}")
void myMethod() { }
----


=== Identity

By default, a unique identifier is generated for each scheduled method.
This identifier is used in log messages, during debugging and as a parameter of some `io.quarkus.scheduler.Scheduler` methods.
Therefore, a possibility to specify an explicit identifier may come in handy.

.Identity Example
[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(identity = "myScheduledMethod")
void myMethod() { }
----

The `identity` attribute supports <<config-reference#property-expressions,Property Expressions>> including default values and nested
Property Expressions. (Note that `"{property.path}"` style expressions are still supported but don't offer the full functionality of Property Expressions.)

.Interval Config Property Example
[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(identity = "${myMethod.identity.expr}")
void myMethod() { }
----

=== Delayed Execution

`@Scheduled` provides two ways to delay the time a trigger should start firing at.

`@Scheduled#delay()` and `@Scheduled#delayUnit()` form the initial delay together.

[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(every = "2s", delay = 2, delayUnit = TimeUnit.HOUR) <1>
void everyTwoSeconds() { }
----
<1> The trigger fires for the first time two hours after the application start.

NOTE: The final value is always rounded to full second.

`@Scheduled#delayed()` is a text alternative to the properties above.
The period expression is based on the ISO-8601 duration format `PnDTnHnMn.nS` and the value is parsed with `java.time.Duration#parse(CharSequence)`. 
However, if an expression starts with a digit, the `PT` prefix is added automatically.
So for example, `15s` can be used instead of `PT15S` and is parsed as "15 seconds".

[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(every = "2s", delayed = "2h")
void everyTwoSeconds() { }
----

NOTE: If `@Scheduled#delay()` is set to a value greater than zero the value of `@Scheduled#delayed()` is ignored.

The main advantage over `@Scheduled#delay()` is that the value is configurable.
The `delay` attribute supports <<config-reference#property-expressions,Property Expressions>> including default values and nested
Property Expressions. (Note that `"{property.path}"` style expressions are still supported but don't offer the full functionality of Property Expressions.)


[source,java]
----
@Scheduled(every = "2s", delayed = "${myMethod.delay.expr}") <1>
void everyTwoSeconds() { }
----
<1> The config property `myMethod.delay.expr` is used to set the delay.

[[concurrent_execution]]
=== Concurrent Execution

By default, a scheduled method can be executed concurrently.
Nevertheless, it is possible to specify the strategy to handle concurrent executions via `@Scheduled#concurrentExecution()`.

[source,java]
----
import static io.quarkus.scheduler.Scheduled.ConcurrentExecution.SKIP;

@Scheduled(every = "1s", concurrentExecution = SKIP) <1>
void nonConcurrent() {
  // we can be sure that this method is never executed concurrently
}
----
<1> Concurrent executions are skipped.

TIP: A CDI event of type `io.quarkus.scheduler.SkippedExecution` is fired when an execution of a scheduled method is skipped.

NOTE: Note that only executions within the same application instance are considered. This feature is not intended to work across the cluster.

[[conditional_execution]]
=== Conditional Execution

You can define the logic to skip any execution of a scheduled method via `@Scheduled#skipExecutionIf()`.
The specified bean class must implement `io.quarkus.scheduler.Scheduled.SkipPredicate` and the execution is skipped if the result of the `test()` method is `true`.

[source,java]
----
class Jobs {
  
   @Scheduled(every = "1s", skipExecutionIf = MyPredicate.class) <1>
   void everySecond() {
     // do something every second...
   }
}

@Singleton <2>
class MyPredicate implements SkipPredicate {

   @Inject
   MyService service;

   boolean test(ScheduledExecution execution) {
       return !service.isStarted(); <3>
   }
}
----
<1> A bean instance of `MyPredicate.class` is used to evaluate whether an execution should be skipped. There must be exactly one bean that has the specified class in its set of bean types, otherwise the build fails.
<2> The scope of the bean must be active during execution.
<3> `Jobs.everySecond()` is skipped until `MyService.isStarted()` returns `true`.

Note that this is an equivalent of the following code:

[source,java]
----
class Jobs {

   @Inject
   MyService service;
  
   @Scheduled(every = "1s")
   void everySecond() {
     if (service.isStarted()) {
        // do something every second...
     }
   }
}
----

The main idea is to keep the logic to skip the execution outside the scheduled business methods so that it can be reused and refactored easily.

TIP: A CDI event of type `io.quarkus.scheduler.SkippedExecution` is fired when an execution of a scheduled method is skipped.

[[non-blocking-methods]]
=== Non-blocking Methods

By default, a scheduled method is executed on the main executor for blocking tasks. 
As a result, a technology that is designed to run on a Vert.x event loop (such as Hibernate Reactive) cannot be used inside the method body.
For this reason, a scheduled method that returns `java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage<Void>` or `io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni<Void>`, or is annotated with `@io.smallrye.common.annotation.NonBlocking` is executed on the Vert.x event loop instead.

[source,java]
----
class Jobs {
  
   @Scheduled(every = "1s")
   Uni<Void> everySecond() { <1>
     // ...do something async
   }
}
----
<1> The return type `Uni<Void>` instructs the scheduler to execute the method on the Vert.x event loop.

== Scheduler

Quarkus provides a built-in bean of type `io.quarkus.scheduler.Scheduler` that can be injected and used to pause/resume the scheduler and individual scheduled methods identified by a specific `Scheduled#identity()`.

.Scheduler Injection Example
[source,java]
----
import io.quarkus.scheduler.Scheduler;

class MyService {

   @Inject
   Scheduler scheduler;

   void ping() {
      scheduler.pause(); <1>
      scheduler.pause("myIdentity"); <2>
      if (scheduler.isRunning()) {
         throw new IllegalStateException("This should never happen!");
      }
      scheduler.resume("myIdentity"); <3>
      scheduler.resume(); <4>
      scheduler.getScheduledJobs(); <5>
      Trigger jobTrigger = scheduler.getScheduledJob("myIdentity"); <6>
      if (jobTrigger != null && jobTrigger.isOverdue()){ <7>
        // the job is late to the party.
      }
   }
}
----
<1> Pause all triggers.
<2> Pause a specific scheduled method by its identity
<3> Resume a specific scheduled method by its identity
<4> Resume the scheduler.
<5> List all jobs in the scheduler.
<6> Get Trigger metadata for a specific scheduled job by its identity.
<7> You can configure the grace period for isOverdue() with quarkus.scheduler.overdue-grace-period

== Programmatic Scheduling

If you need to schedule a job programmatically you'll need to add the xref:quartz.adoc[Quartz extension] and use the Quartz API directly.

.Programmatic Scheduling with Quartz API
[source,java]
----
import org.quartz.Scheduler;

class MyJobs {

    void onStart(@Observes StartupEvent event, Scheduler quartz) throws SchedulerException {
        JobDetail job = JobBuilder.newJob(SomeJob.class)
                .withIdentity("myJob", "myGroup")
                .build();
        Trigger trigger = TriggerBuilder.newTrigger()
                .withIdentity("myTrigger", "myGroup")
                .startNow()
                .withSchedule(SimpleScheduleBuilder.simpleSchedule()
                        .withIntervalInSeconds(1)
                        .repeatForever())
                .build();
        quartz.scheduleJob(job, trigger);
    }
}
----

NOTE: By default, the scheduler is not started unless a `@Scheduled` business method is found. You may need to force the start of the scheduler for "pure" programmatic scheduling. See also <<quartz.adoc#quartz-configuration-reference,Quartz Configuration Reference>>.

== Scheduled Methods and Testing

It is often desirable to disable the scheduler when running the tests.
The scheduler can be disabled through the runtime config property `quarkus.scheduler.enabled`.
If set to `false` the scheduler is not started even though the application contains scheduled methods.
You can even disable the scheduler for particular <<getting-started-testing#testing_different_profiles,Test Profiles>>.

== Metrics

Some basic metrics are published out of the box if `quarkus.scheduler.metrics.enabled` is set to `true` and a metrics extension is present. 

If the xref:micrometer.adoc[Micrometer extension] is present, then a `@io.micrometer.core.annotation.Timed` interceptor binding is added to all `@Scheduled` methods automatically (unless it's already present) and a `io.micrometer.core.instrument.Timer` with name `scheduled.methods` and a `io.micrometer.core.instrument.LongTaskTimer` with name `scheduled.methods.running` are registered. The fully qualified name of the declaring class and the name of a `@Scheduled` method are used as tags.

If the xref:smallrye-metrics.adoc[SmallRye Metrics extension] is present, then a `@org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation.Timed`  interceptor binding is added to all `@Scheduled` methods automatically (unless it's already present) and a `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.Timer` is created for each `@Scheduled` method. The name consists of the fully qualified name of the declaring class and the name of a `@Scheduled` method. The timer has a tag `scheduled=true`.

== OpenTelemetry Tracing

If `quarkus.scheduler.tracing.enabled` is set to `true` and the xref:opentelemetry.adoc[OpenTelemetry extension] is present then the `@io.opentelemetry.instrumentation.annotations.WithSpan` annotation is added automatically to every `@Scheduled` method. As a result, each execution of this method has a new `io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Span` associated.

IMPORTANT: <<non-blocking-methods,Non-blocking methods>> are not supported, i.e. a new span is associated with the _actual_ invocation but it's not available within the asynchronous computation.
