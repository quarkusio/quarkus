[[project-creation]]
== Creating a new project

With Maven, you can scaffold a new project with:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=my-groupId \
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-artifactId \
    -DprojectVersion=my-version \
    -DclassName="org.my.group.MyResource"
----

NOTE: If you just launch `mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create` the Maven plugin asks
for user inputs. You can disable (and use default values) this interactive mode by passing `-B` to the Maven command.

The following table lists the attributes you can pass to the `create` command:

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Attribute
| Default Value
| Description

| `projectGroupId`
| `org.acme.sample`
| The group id of the created project

| `projectArtifactId`
| _mandatory_
| The artifact id of the created project. Not passing it triggers the interactive mode.

| `projectVersion`
| `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
| The version of the created project

| `platformGroupId`
| `io.quarkus`
| The group id of the target platform. Given that all the existing platforms are coming from `io.quarkus` this one won't practically be used explicitly. But it's still an option.

| `platformArtifactId`
| `quarkus-universe-bom`
| The artifact id of the target platform BOM. It should be `quarkus-bom` in order to use the locally built Quarkus.

| `platformVersion`
| If it's not specified, the latest one will be resolved.
| The version of the platform you want the project to use. It can also accept a version range, in which case the latest from the specified range will be used.

| `className`
| _Not created if omitted_
| The fully qualified name of the generated resource

| `path`
| `/hello`
| The resource path, only relevant if `className` is set.

| `extensions`
| _[]_
| The list of extensions to add to the project (comma-separated)

|===

By default, the command will target the latest version of `quarkus-universe-bom` (unless specific coordinates have been specified). If you run offline however, it will look for the latest locally available and if `quarkus-universe-bom` (satisfying the default version range which is currently up to 2.0) is not available locally, it will fallback to the bundled platform based on `quarkus-bom` (the version will match the version of the plugin).

If you decide to generate a REST resource (using the `className` attribute), the endpoint is exposed at: `http://localhost:8080/$path`.
If you use the default `path`, the URL is: http://localhost:8080/hello.

The project is generated in a directory named after the passed artifactId.
If the directory already exists, the generation fails.

A pair of Dockerfiles for native and jvm mode are also generated in `src/main/docker`.
Instructions to build the image and run the container are written in those Dockerfiles.

== Dealing with extensions

From inside a Quarkus project, you can obtain a list of the available extensions with:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:list-extensions
----

You can enable an extension using:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="hibernate-validator"
----

Extensions are passed using a comma-separated list.

The extension name is the GAV name of the extension: e.g. `io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal`.
But you can pass a partial name and Quarkus will do its best to find the right extension.
For example, `agroal`, `Agroal` or `agro`  will expand to `io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal`.
If no extension is found or if more than one extensions match, you will see a red check mark  ❌ in the command result.

[source,shell]
----
$ ./mvnw quarkus:add-extensions -Dextensions=jdbc,agroal,non-exist-ent
[...]
❌ Multiple extensions matching 'jdbc'
     * io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-h2
     * io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-mariadb
     * io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-postgresql
     Be more specific e.g using the exact name or the full gav.
✅ Adding extension io.quarkus:quarkus-agroal
❌ Cannot find a dependency matching 'non-exist-ent', maybe a typo?
[...]
----

You can install all extensions which match a globbing pattern :

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="hibernate-*"
----

[[dev-mode]]
== Development mode

Quarkus comes with a built-in development mode.
Run your application with:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
----

You can then update the application sources, resources and configurations.
The changes are automatically reflected in your running application.
This is great to do development spanning UI and database as you see changes reflected immediately.

`quarkus:dev` enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means
that when you modify your Java files or your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect.
This works too for resource files like the configuration property file.
The act of
refreshing the browser triggers a scan of the workspace, and if any changes are detected the Java files are compiled,
and the application is redeployed, then your request is serviced by the redeployed application. If there are any issues
with compilation or deployment an error page will let you know.

Hit `CTRL+C` to stop the application.

[NOTE]
====
By default, `quarkus:dev` sets the debug host to `localhost` (for security reasons). If you need to change this, for example to enable debugging on all hosts, you can use the `-DdebugHost` option like so:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev -DdebugHost=0.0.0.0
----
====

=== Remote Development Mode

It is possible to use development mode remotely, so that you can run Quarkus in a container environment (such as OpenShift)
and have changes made to your local files become immediately visible.

This allows you to develop in the same environment you will actually run your app in, and with access to the same services.

WARNING: Do not use this in production. This should only be used in a development environment. You should not run production application in dev mode.

To do this you must build a mutable application, using the `mutable-jar` format. Set the following properties in `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.package.type=mutable-jar <1>
quarkus.live-reload.password=changeit <2>
quarkus.live-reload.url=http://my.cluster.host.com:8080 <3>
----
<1> This tells Quarkus to use the mutable-jar format. Mutable applications also include the deployment time parts of Quarkus,
so they take up a bit more disk space. If run normally they start just as fast and use the same memory as an immutable application,
however they can also be started in dev mode.
<2> The password that is used to secure communication between the remote side and the local side.
<3> The URL that your app is going to be running in dev mode at. This is only needed on the local side, so you
may want to leave it out of the properties file and specify it as a system property on the command line.

The `mutable-jar` is then built in the same way that a regular Quarkus jar is built, i.e. by issuing:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package
----

Before you start Quarkus on the remote host set the environment variable `QUARKUS_LAUNCH_DEVMODE=true`. If you are
on bare metal you can set it via the `export QUARKUS_LAUNCH_DEVMODE=true` command and then run the application with the proper `java -jar ...` command to run the application.

If you plan on running the application via Docker, then you'll need to add `-e QUARKUS_LAUNCH_DEVMODE=true` to the `docker run` command.
When the application starts you should now see the following line in the logs: `Profile dev activated. Live Coding activated`.

NOTE: The remote side does not need to include Maven or any other development tools. The normal `fast-jar` Dockerfile
that is generated with a new Quarkus application is all you need. If you are using bare metal launch the Quarkus runner
jar, do not attempt to run normal devmode.

Now you need to connect your local agent to the remote host, using the `remote-dev` command:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:remote-dev -Dquarkus.live-reload.url=http://my-remote-host:8080
----

Now every time you refresh the browser you should see any changes you have made locally immediately visible in the remote
app. This is done via a HTTP based long polling transport, that will synchronize your local workspace and the remote
application via HTTP calls.

If you do not want to use the HTTP feature then you can simply run the `remote-dev` command without specifying the URL.
In this mode the command will continuously rebuild the local application, so you can use an external tool such as odo or
rsync to sync to the remote application.

All the config options are shown below:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-live-reload-live-reload-config.adoc[opts=optional, leveloffset=+1]

NOTE: It is recommended you use SSL when using remote dev mode, however even if you are using an unencrypted connection
your password is never sent directly over the wire. For the initial connection request the password is hashed with the
initial state data, and subsequent requests hash it with a random session id generated by the server and any body contents
for POST requests, and the path for DELETE requests, as well as an incrementing counter to prevent replay attacks.

=== Configuring Development Mode

By default, the Maven plugin picks up compiler flags to pass to
`javac` from `maven-compiler-plugin`.

If you need to customize the compiler flags used in development mode,
add a `configuration` section to the `plugin` block and set the
`compilerArgs` property just as you would when configuring
`maven-compiler-plugin`.  You can also set `source`, `target`, and
`jvmArgs`.  For example, to pass `--enable-preview` to both the JVM
and `javac`:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${quarkus-plugin.version}</version>

  <configuration>
    <source>${maven.compiler.source}</source>
    <target>${maven.compiler.target}</target>
    <compilerArgs>
      <arg>--enable-preview</arg>
    </compilerArgs>
    <jvmArgs>--enable-preview</jvmArgs>
  </configuration>

  ...
</plugin>
----


== Debugging

In development mode, Quarkus starts by default with debug mode enabled, listening to port `5005` without suspending the JVM.

This behavior can be changed by giving the `debug` system property one of the following values:

* `false` - the JVM will start with debug mode disabled
* `true` - The JVM is started in debug mode and will be listening on port `5005`
* `client` - the JVM will start in client mode and attempt to connect to `localhost:5005`
* `{port}` - The JVM is started in debug mode and will be listening on `{port}`

An additional system property `suspend` can be used to suspend the JVM, when launched in debug mode. `suspend` supports the following values:

* `y` or `true` - The debug mode JVM launch is suspended
* `n` or `false` - The debug mode JVM is started without suspending


[TIP]
====
You can also run a Quarkus application in debug mode with a suspended JVM using `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev -Dsuspend` which is a shorthand for `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev -Dsuspend=true`.

Then, attach your debugger to `localhost:5005`.
====

== Import in your IDE

Once you have a <<project-creation, project generated>>, you can import it in your favorite IDE.
The only requirement is the ability to import a Maven project.

**Eclipse**

In Eclipse, click on: `File -> Import`.
In the wizard, select: `Maven -> Existing Maven Project`.
On the next screen, select the root location of the project.
The next screen list the found modules; select the generated project and click on `Finish`. Done!

In a separated terminal, run `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev`, and enjoy a highly productive environment.

**IntelliJ**

In IntelliJ:

1. From inside IntelliJ select `File -> New -> Project From Existing Sources...` or, if you are on the welcome dialog, select `Import project`.
2. Select the project root
3. Select `Import project from external model` and `Maven`
4. Next a few times (review the different options if needed)
5. On the last screen click on Finish

In a separated terminal or in the embedded terminal, run `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev`. Enjoy!

**Apache NetBeans**

In NetBeans:

1. Select `File -> Open Project`
2. Select the project root
3. Click on `Open Project`

In a separated terminal or the embedded terminal, go to the project root and run `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev`. Enjoy!

**Visual Studio Code**

Open the project directory in VS Code. If you have installed the Java Extension Pack (grouping a set of Java extensions), the project is loaded as a Maven project.

== Logging Quarkus application build classpath tree

Usually, dependencies of an application (which is a Maven project) could be displayed using `mvn dependency:tree` command. In case of a Quarkus application, however, this command will list only the runtime dependencies of the application.
Given that the Quarkus build process adds deployment dependencies of the extensions used in the application to the original application classpath, it could be useful to know which dependencies and which versions end up on the build classpath.
Luckily, the `quarkus` Maven plugin includes the `dependency-tree` goal which displays the build dependency tree for the application.

Executing `./mvnw quarkus:dependency-tree` on your project should result in an output similar to:

[source,text,subs=attributes+]
----
[INFO] --- quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:build-tree (default-cli) @ getting-started ---
[INFO] org.acme:getting-started:jar:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

[INFO]    │  │  │  └─ commons-collections:commons-collections:jar:3.2.2 (compile)
...
----

The goal accepts the optional `mode` parameter whose default value is `prod`, i.e. the production build dependency tree. Alternatively, it accepts values `test` to display the test dependency tree and `dev` to display the dev mode dependency tree.

== Building a native executable

Native executables make Quarkus applications ideal for containers and serverless workloads.

Make sure to have `GRAALVM_HOME` configured and pointing to GraalVM version {graalvm-version} (Make sure to use a Java 11 version of GraalVM).
Verify that your `pom.xml` has the proper `native` profile (see <<build-tool-maven>>).

Create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.
A native executable will be present in `target/`.

To run Integration Tests on the native executable, make sure to have the proper Maven plugin configured (see <<build-tool-maven>>) and launch the `verify` goal.

=== Build a container friendly executable

The native executable will be specific to your operating system.
To create an executable that will run in a container, use the following:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
----

The produced executable will be a 64 bit Linux executable, so depending on your operating system it may no longer be runnable.
However, it's not an issue as we are going to copy it to a Docker container.
Note that in this case the build itself runs in a Docker container too, so you don't need to have GraalVM installed locally.

[TIP]
====
By default, the native executable will be generated using the `quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-native-image:{graalvm-flavor}` Docker image.

If you want to build a native executable with a different Docker image (for instance to use a different GraalVM version),
use the `-Dquarkus.native.builder-image=<image name>` build argument.

The list of the available Docker images can be found on https://quay.io/repository/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-native-image?tab=tags[quay.io].
Be aware that a given Quarkus version might not be compatible with all the images available.
====

You can follow the link:building-native-image[Build a native executable guide] as well as link:deploying-to-kubernetes[Deploying Application to Kubernetes and OpenShift] for more information.

----

<1> Optionally use a BOM file to omit the version of the different Quarkus dependencies.
<2> Use the Quarkus Maven plugin that will hook into the build process.
<3> Enabling Maven plugin extensions will register a Quarkus `MavenLifecycleParticipant` which will make sure the Quarkus classloaders used during the build are properly closed. During the `generate-code` and `generate-code-tests` goals the Quarkus application bootstrap is initialized and re-used in the `build` goal (which actually builds and packages a production application). The Quarkus classloaders will be properly closed in the `build` goal of the `quarkus-maven-plugin`. However, if the build fails in between the `generate-code` or `generate-code-tests` and `build` then the Quarkus augmentation classloader won't be properly closed, which may lead to locking of JAR files that happened to be on the classpath on Windows OS.
<4> Add system properties to `maven-surefire-plugin`. +
`maven.home` is only required if you have custom configuration in `${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml`.
<5> Use a specific `native` profile for native executable building.
<6> Enable the `native` package type. The build will therefore produce a native executable.
<7> If you want to test your native executable with Integration Tests, add the following plugin configuration. Test names `*IT` and annotated `@NativeImageTest` will be run against the native executable. See the link:building-native-image[Native executable guide] for more info.

[[fast-jar]]
=== Using fast-jar

`fast-jar` is now the default quarkus package type. The result of `./mvnw package` command is a new directory under `target` named `quarkus-app`.

You can run the application using: `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

WARNING: In order to successfully run the produced jar, you need to have the entire contents of the `quarkus-app` directory. If any of the files are missing, the application will not start or
might not function correctly.

TIP: The `fast-jar` packaging results in creating an artifact that starts a little faster and consumes slightly less memory than a legacy Quarkus jar
because it has indexed information about which dependency jar contains classes and resources. It can thus avoid the lookup into potentially every jar
on the classpath that the legacy jar necessitates, when loading a class or resource.

[[uber-jar-maven]]
=== Uber-Jar Creation

Quarkus Maven plugin supports the generation of Uber-Jars by specifying a `quarkus.package.type=uber-jar` configuration option in your `application.properties`
(or `<quarkus.package.type>uber-jar</quarkus.package.type>` in your `pom.xml`).

The original jar will still be present in the `target` directory but it will be renamed to contain the `.original` suffix.

When building an Uber-Jar you can specify entries that you want to exclude from the generated jar by using the `quarkus.package.ignored-entries` configuration
option, this takes a comma separated list of entries to ignore.

Uber-Jar creation by default excludes link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/intro.html[signature files] that might be present in the dependencies of the application.

Uber-Jar's final name is configurable via a Maven's build settings `finalName` option.

[[multi-module-maven]]
=== Working with multi-module projects

By default, Quarkus will not discover CDI beans inside another module.

The best way to enable CDI bean discovery for a module in a multi-module project would be to include the `jandex-maven-plugin`,
unless it is the main application module already configured with the quarkus-maven-plugin, in which case it will indexed automatically.

=== Building with a specific configuration profile

Quarkus supports xref:config-reference.adoc#profiles[configuration profiles] in order to provide a specific configuration according to the target environment.

The profile can be provided directly in the Maven build's command thanks to the system property `quarkus.profile` with a command of type `./mvnw package -Dquarkus.profile=<profile-name-here>`,
however it is also possible to specify the profile directly in the POM file of the project using project properties, the Quarkus Maven plugin configuration properties or system properties set in the Quarkus Maven plugin configuration.

In order of precedence (greater precedence first):

[[maven-multi-build]]
=== Building several artifacts from a single module

In some particular use cases, it can be interesting to build several artifacts of your application from the same module.
A typical example is when you want to build your application with different configuration profiles.

In that case, it is possible to add as many executions as needed to the Quarkus Maven plugin configuration.

Below is an example of a Quarkus Maven plugin configuration that will produce two builds of the same application: one  using the `prod-oracle` profile and the other one using the `prod-postgresql` profile.

<3> The default configuration profile of the second execution of the plugin is `prod-postgresql`.
<4> The output directory of the second execution of the plugin is set to `postgresql-quarkus-app` instead of `quarkus-app` to have a dedicated directory.

NOTE: With the configuration above, both profile builds will be using the same dependencies, so if we added dependencies on the Oracle and PostgreSQL drivers to the application, both of the drivers will appear in both builds.


To isolate profile-specific dependencies from other profiles, the JDBC drivers could be added as optional dependencies to the application but configured to be included in each profile that requires them, e.g.:

== Configuring the Project Output

There are a several configuration options that will define what the output of your project build will be.
These are provided in `application.properties` the same as any other config property.

The properties are shown below:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-package-pkg-package-config.adoc[opts=optional]

[[custom-test-configuration-profile]]
=== Custom test configuration profile in JVM mode

By default, Quarkus tests in JVM mode are run using the `test` configuration profile. If you are not familiar with Quarkus
configuration profiles, everything you need to know is explained in the
link:config#configuration-profiles[Configuration Profiles Documentation].

It is however possible to use a custom configuration profile for your tests with the Maven Surefire and Maven Failsafe
configurations shown below. This can be useful if you need for example to run some tests using a specific database which is not
your default testing database.

It is not possible to use a custom test configuration profile in native mode for now. Native tests are always run using the
`prod` profile.

[[bootstrap-maven-properties]]
=== Bootstrap Maven properties

Quarkus bootstrap includes a Maven resolver implementation that is used to resolve application runtime and build time dependencies. The Quarkus Maven resolver is initialized from the same Maven command line that launched the build, test or dev mode. Typically, there is no need to add any extra configuration for it. However, there could be cases where an extra configuration option may be necessary to properly resolve application dependencies in test or dev modes, or IDEs.

Maven test plugins (such as `surefire` and `failsafe`), for example, are not propagating build system properties to the running tests by default. Which means some of the system properties set by the Maven CLI aren't available for the Quarkus Maven resolver initialized for the tests, which may result in test dependencies being resolved using different settings than the main Maven build.

Here is a list of system properties the Quarkus bootstrap Maven resolver checks during its initialization.

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Property name
| Default Value
| Description

| `maven.home`
| `MAVEN_HOME` envvar
| The Maven home dir is used to resolve the global settings file unless it was explicitly provided on the command line with the `-gs` argument

| `maven.settings`
| `~/m2/settings.xml`
| Unless the custom settings file has been provided with the `-s` argument, this property can be used to point the resolver to a custom Maven settings file

| `maven.repo.local`
| `~/m2/repository`
| This property could be used to configure a custom local Maven repository directory, if it is different from the default one and the one specified in the `settings.xml`

| `maven.top-level-basedir`
| none
| This property may be useful to help the Maven resolver identify the top-level Maven project in the workspace. By default, the Maven resolver will be discovering a project's workspace by navigating the parent-module POM relationship. However there could be project layouts that are using an aggregator module which isn't appearing as the parent for its modules. In this case, this property will help the Quarkus Maven resolver to properly discover the workspace.

| `quarkus.bootstrap.effective-model-builder`
| `false`
| By default, the Quarkus Maven resolver is reading project's POMs directly when discovering the project's layout. While in most cases it works well enough and relatively fast, reading raw POMs has its limitation. E.g. if a POM includes modules in a profile, these modules will not be discovered. This system property enables project's layout discovery based on the effective POM models, that are properly interpolated, instead of the raw ones. The reason this option is not enabled by default is it may appear to be significantly more time consuming that could increase, e.g. CI testing times. Until there is a better approach found that could be used by default, projects that require it should enable this option.

|===

These system properties above could be added to, e.g., a `surefire` and/or `failsafe` plugin configuration as

==== Top-level vs Multi-module project directory

In Maven there appears to be a notion of the top-level project (that is exposed as a project property `${session.topLevelProject.basedir.absolutePath}`)
and the multi-module project directory (that is available as property `${maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory}`). These directories might not always match!

IMPORTANT: `maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory` is meant to be consulted by the Maven code itself and not something to be relied upon by user code. So, if you find it useful, use it at your own risk!

The `${maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory}` will be resolved to the first directory that contains `.mvn` directory as its child going up the workspace file system tree
starting from the current directory (or the one specified with the `-f` argument) from which the `mvn` command was launched. If the `.mvn` directory was not found, however,
the `${maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory}` will be pointing to the directory from which the `mvn` command was launched (or the one targeted with the `-f` argument).

The `${session.topLevelProject.basedir.absolutePath}` will be pointing either to the directory from which the `mvn` command was launched or to the directory targeted with
the `-f` argument, if it was specified.
