= Dev Services for Infinispan
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: data
:summary: Start Infinispan automatically in dev and test modes.
:topics: dev-services,data,infinispan,testing,dev-mode
:extensions: io.quarkus:quarkus-infinispan-client

Quarkus supports a feature called Dev Services that allows you to create various datasources without any config.
If you have docker running and have not configured `quarkus.infinispan-client.hosts`,
Quarkus will automatically start an Infinispan container when running tests or dev mode, and automatically configure the connection.

When running the production version of the application, the Infinispan connection need to be configured as normal,
so if you want to include a production database config in your `application.properties` and continue to use Dev Services
we recommend that you use the `%prod.` profile to define your Infinispan settings.

Dev Services for Infinispan relies on Docker/Podman to start the server.

== Connecting to the running Infinispan Server

You *don't need to configure anything in dev mode*.
The server will be running in a random port.
If you need a fixed port, then configure `quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.port` property.

[NOTE]
====
The running Infinispan Server has authentication enabled and a user with full admin role.
The credentials of the user are *admin/password*.
====

=== Accessing to the Infinispan Server Console
Infinispan Server provides a web console that can be accessed with a browser:

. Open the xref:dev-ui.adoc[Dev UI]
. You will see an *Infinispan Client* box. Click on  *Web Console* and enter the credentials above.

If your environment does not support Docker, you will need to spin up an Infinispan Server manually, or connect to an already running server.

== Overriding the Infinispan Server Image

The extension is updated regularly and the Dev Services will start the latest final version image of Infinispan.
Use `quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.image-name` property to specify another image that fits your needs.

==  Enabling / Disabling Dev Services for Infinispan

Dev Services for Infinispan is automatically enabled unless:

- `quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.enabled` is set to `false`
- the `quarkus.infinispan-client.hosts` is configured

Dev Services for Infinispan relies on Docker to start the broker.
If your environment does not support Docker, you will need to start the broker manually, or connect to an already running broker.
You can configure the broker address using `quarkus.infinispan-client.hosts`.

== Providing configuration to the running server
Dev Services for Infinispan will spin up an Infinispan with the infinispan.xml file by default.
However, there are cases where is helpful to provide some extra configuration to the server.
This can be done by adding configuration files in xml, yaml or json to the resources classpath and
providing the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.config-files=server-config-override.xml <1>
----
<1> server-config-override.xml is a file under the resources folder

[source,xml]
----
<infinispan> <1>
    <cache-container>
        <local-cache name="my-local-cache"> <2>
            <encoding media-type="application/x-protostream" />
        </local-cache>
    </cache-container>
</infinispan>
----
<1> The content of server-config-override.xml file
<2> By providing a cache configuration, this cache will be present on the server container

== Cross Site Replication
If you want run the Infinispan Server container with Cross Site Replication configuration, you need to provide a site name.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.site=NYC <1>
quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.mcast-port=46666 <2>
----

<1> Provides a site name for your Infinispan cluster
<2> Eventually configure a mcastPort if you want to avoid creating a cluster with another container

[NOTE]
====
Learn more about Cross Site Replication in the Infinispan Cross Site Replication link:https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/xsite/xsite.html[documentation guide]
and in the Infinispan Cross Site Replication
link:https://infinispan.org/tutorials/simple/simple_tutorials.html#cross-site-replication_remote-cache-tutorials[simple code tutorial].
====

== Multiple Dev Services for named connections
The Infinispan Client extension supports connecting to more than one Infinispan Cluster with
the named connections. If you need to spin an additional Dev Service for a connection name, configure
at least on property in the application properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.infinispan-client.conn-2.devservices.enabled=true
----

== Tracing with OpenTelemetry

Infinispan supports server tracing using OpenTelemetry. Starting from Infinispan 15.0, you need
to configure tracing in the server's settings.
To enable tracing in Dev Services, you need to add extra settings using the
`quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.config-files` property.

[source, yaml]
----
infinispan:
        cacheContainer:
                tracing:
                        collector-endpoint: "http://jaeger:4318" <1>
                        enabled: true <2>
                        exporter-protocol: "OTLP" <3>
                        service-name: "infinispan-server" <4>
                        security: false <5>
----
<1> Collector endpoint. Assuming a container service name 'jaeger' is running.
<2> Enables tracing.
<3> Exporter protocol. OLTP is the OpenTelemetry protocol.
<4> The service name that will be registered in the tracing collector, Jaeger in this case.
<5> Enables 'security' category tracing.

See below the equivalent in XML and JSON.

[source, xml]
----
<infinispan>
  <cache-container statistics="true">
    <tracing collector-endpoint="http://jaeger:4318"
             enabled="true"
             exporter-protocol="OTLP"
             service-name="infinispan-server"
             security="false" />
  </cache-container>
</infinispan>
----

[source, json]
----
{
  "infinispan" : {
    "cache-container" : {
      "statistics" : true,
      "tracing" : {
        "collector-endpoint" : "http://jaeger:4318",
        "enabled" : true,
        "exporter-protocol" : "OTLP",
        "service-name" : "infinispan-server",
        "security" : false
      }
    }
  }
}
----

You need to name the Jaeger service or get the IP running the following command to configure the exporter endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' jaeger
----

== Persistence layer for Infinispan

Infinispan caches provide several features that need to connect to a persistence layer using a
particular SQL database driver such as persisting caches in a SQL database or off-loading database
tables or queries with SQL cache stores.

Infinispan needs the SQL Java Driver depending on the database kind the application is using.
To spin up a container with a particular SQL driver, configure `quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.artifacts`.


TIP: Learn more about persistence and SQL Cache Stores check the https://github.com/infinispan-demos/infinispan-sqlstore-demo[SQL Store Demo + Quarkus Demo] and
the https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/configuring/configuring.html#persistence[Infinispan Persistence Documentation] guide.


== Shared server

Most of the time you need to share the server between applications.
Dev Services for Infinispan implements a _service discovery_ mechanism for your multiple Quarkus applications running in _dev_ mode to share a single server.

NOTE: Dev Services for Infinispan starts the container with the `infinispan` label which is used to identify the container.

If you need multiple (shared) servers, you can configure the `quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.service-name` attribute and indicate the server name.
It looks for a container with the same value, or starts a new one if none can be found.
The default service name is `infinispan`.

Sharing is enabled by default in dev mode, but disabled in test mode.
You can disable the sharing with `quarkus.infinispan-client.devservices.shared=false`

== Compose

Dev Services for Infinispan supports xref:compose-dev-services.adoc[Compose Dev Services].
It relies on a `compose-devservices.yml`, such as:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
name: test-project
services:
  infinispan:
    image: {infinispan-image}
    ports:
      - '11222'
    environment:
      - USER=quarkus
      - PASS=quarkus
----
