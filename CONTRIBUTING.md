# Contributing guide

**Want to contribute? Great!** 
We try to make it easy, and all contributions, even the smaller ones, are more than welcome.
This includes bug reports, fixes, documentation, examples... 
But first, read this page (including the small print at the end).

## Reporting an issue

This project uses Github issues to manage the issues. Open an issue directly in Github.

If you believe you found a bug, and it's likely possible, please indicate a way to reproduce it, what you are seeing and what you would expect to see.
Don't forget to indicate your Java, Maven and GraalVM version. 

## Before you contribute

To contribute, use Github Pull Requests, from your **own** fork.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, need to be reviewed before being merged.

### Continuous Integration

Because we are all humans, the project uses a continuous integration approach and each pull request triggers a full build.
Please make sure to monitor the output of the build and act accordingly.

### Tests and documentation are not optional

Don't forget to include tests in your pull requests. 
Also don't forget the documentation (reference documentation, javadoc...).

Be sure to test your pull request in:

1. Java mode
2. Native mode

## Setup   

If you have not done so on this machine, you need to:
 
* Install Git and configure your Github access
* Install Java SDK (OpenJDK recommended)
* Download and Apache Maven (3.5+) 
* Install [GraalVM](http://www.graalvm.org/downloads/) (community edition is enough)
* Install platform C developer tools:
    * Linux
        * Make sure headers are available on your system (you'll hit 'Basic header file missing (<zlib.h>)' error if they aren't).
            * On Fedora `sudo dnf install zlib-devel`
            * Otherwise `sudo apt-get install libz-dev`
    * macOS
        * `xcode-select --install` 
* Set `GRAALVM_HOME` to your GraalVM Home directory e.g. `/opt/graalvm` on Linux or `$location/JDK/GraalVM/Contents/Home` on macOS

Docker is not strictly necessary: it is used to run the MariaDB and PostgreSQL tests which are not enabled by default. However it is a recommended install if you plan to work on Quarkus JPA support:

* Check [the installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and [the MacOS installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* If you just install docker, be sure that your current user can run a container (no root required). 
On Linux, check [the post-installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)         
        
## Build

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jbossas/quarkus.git`
* Navigate to the directory: `cd quarkus`
* Invoke `mvn clean install` from the root directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jbossas/quarkus.git
cd quarkus
mvn clean install
# Wait... success!
```

The default build will create two different native images, which is quite time consuming. You can skip this
by disabling the `native-image` profile: `mvn install -Dno-native`.

By default the build will use the native image server. This speeds up the build, but can cause problems due to the cache
not being invalidated correctly in some cases. To run a build with a new instance of the server you can use
`mvn install -Dnative-image.new-server=true`.

## The small print

This project is an open source project, please act responsibly, be nice, polite and enjoy!
