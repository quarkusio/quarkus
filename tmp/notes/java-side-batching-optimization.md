# Java-Side Batching Optimization

## Problem Fixed ✅
Moved batching logic from TypeScript to Java where it belongs.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Removed TypeScript Batching
- No more artificial 25-project batches in TypeScript
- Single efficient call to Java analyzer
- Java handles all memory management and batching

### 2. Java Logging Optimization
- Reduced verbose DEBUG output by 90%
- Only log every 10th project being processed instead of every project
- Only show summary progress every 25 projects
- Keep important INFO and ERROR messages

### 3. Maintained Java Efficiency Features:
- ✅ Memory cleanup every 50 projects (`System.gc()`)
- ✅ Progress reporting every 50 projects
- ✅ Streaming JSON output to file
- ✅ Immediate model cleanup after processing

## Benefits:
- **CPU usage reduced** - Less verbose logging 
- **Single process** - No multiple Maven spawns
- **Java efficiency** - Memory management handled in Java
- **Cleaner output** - Less debug spam

## Usage:
```bash
# Now much more efficient
nx graph --file graph.json

# Still respects limits
NX_MAVEN_LIMIT=20 nx graph --file graph.json
```

The Java side now handles everything efficiently with minimal logging!
