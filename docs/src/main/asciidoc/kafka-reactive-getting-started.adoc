= Getting Started to SmallRye Reactive Messaging with Apache Kafka
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: messaging
:summary: This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can utilize SmallRye Reactive Messaging to interact with Apache Kafka.

This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can utilize SmallRye Reactive Messaging to interact with Apache Kafka.

== Prerequisites

:prerequisites-docker-compose:
include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]

== Architecture

In this guide, we are going to develop two applications communicating with Kafka.
The first application sends a _quote request_ to Kafka and consumes Kafka messages from the _quote_ topic.
The second application receives the _quote request_ and sends a _quote_ back.

image::kafka-qs-architecture.png[alt=Architecture, align=center]

The first application, the _producer_, will let the user request some quotes over an HTTP endpoint.
For each quote request a random identifier is generated and returned to the user, to mark the quote request as _pending_.
At the same time, the generated request id is sent over a Kafka topic `quote-requests`.

image::kafka-qs-app-screenshot.png[alt=Producer App UI, align=center]

The second application, the _processor_, will read from the `quote-requests` topic, put a random price to the quote, and send it to a Kafka topic named `quotes`.

Lastly, the _producer_ will read the quotes and send them to the browser using server-sent events.
The user will therefore see the quote price updated from _pending_ to the received price in real-time.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create applications step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `kafka-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/kafka-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need to create two projects: the _producer_ and the _processor_.

To create the _producer_ project, in a terminal run:

:create-app-artifact-id: kafka-quickstart-producer
:create-app-extensions: resteasy-reactive-jackson,smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka
:create-app-post-command:
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

This command creates the project structure and selects two Quarkus extensions we will be using:

1. RESTEasy Reactive and its Jackson support (to handle JSON) to serve the HTTP endpoint.
2. The Kafka connector for Reactive Messaging

To create the _processor_ project, from the same directory, run:

:create-app-artifact-id: kafka-quickstart-processor
:create-app-extensions: smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka
:create-app-post-command:
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

At that point, you should have the following structure:

[source, text]

            └── application.properties
----

Open the two projects in your favorite IDE.

[TIP]
.Dev Services
====
No need to start a Kafka broker when using the dev mode or for tests.
Quarkus starts a broker for you automatically.
See xref:kafka-dev-services.adoc[Dev Services for Kafka] for details.
====

== The Quote object

The `Quote` class will be used in both _producer_ and _processor_ projects.
For the sake of simplicity, we will duplicate the class.
In both projects, create the `src/main/java/org/acme/kafka/model/Quote.java` file, with the following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.kafka.model;

public class Quote {

    public String id;
    public int price;

    /**
    * Default constructor required for Jackson serializer
    */
    public Quote() { }

    public Quote(String id, int price) {
        this.id = id;
        this.price = price;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Quote{" +
                "id='" + id + '\'' +
                ", price=" + price +
                '}';
    }
}
----

JSON representation of `Quote` objects will be used in messages sent to the Kafka topic
and also in the server-sent events sent to web browsers.

Quarkus has built-in capabilities to deal with JSON Kafka messages.
In a following section, we will create serializer/deserializer classes for Jackson.

== Sending quote request

Inside the _producer_ project, create the `src/main/java/org/acme/kafka/producer/QuotesResource.java` file and add the following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.kafka.producer;

import java.util.UUID;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import org.acme.kafka.model.Quote;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;

@Path("/quotes")
public class QuotesResource {

    @Channel("quote-requests")
    Emitter<String> quoteRequestEmitter; // <1>

    /**
     * Endpoint to generate a new quote request id and send it to "quote-requests" Kafka topic using the emitter.
     */
    @POST
    @Path("/request")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String createRequest() {
        UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
        quoteRequestEmitter.send(uuid.toString()); // <2>
        return uuid.toString(); // <3>
    }
}
----
<1> Inject a Reactive Messaging `Emitter` to send messages to the `quote-requests` channel.
<2> On a post request, generate a random UUID and send it to the Kafka topic using the emitter.
<3> Return the same UUID to the client.


The `quote-requests` channel is going to be managed as a Kafka topic, as that's the only connector on the classpath.
If not indicated otherwise, like in this example, Quarkus uses the channel name as topic name.
So, in this example, the application writes into the `quote-requests` topic.
Quarkus also configures the serializer automatically, because it finds that the `Emitter` produces `String` values.

TIP: When you have multiple connectors, you would need to indicate which connector you want to use in the application configuration.

== Processing quote requests

Now let's consume the quote request and give out a price.
Inside the _processor_ project, create the `src/main/java/org/acme/kafka/processor/QuotesProcessor.java` file and add the following content:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme.kafka.processor;

import java.util.Random;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

import org.acme.kafka.model.Quote;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;

import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.annotations.Blocking;

/**
 * A bean consuming data from the "quote-requests" Kafka topic (mapped to "requests" channel) and giving out a random quote.
 * The result is pushed to the "quotes" Kafka topic.
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class QuotesProcessor {

    private Random random = new Random();

    @Incoming("requests") // <1>
    @Outgoing("quotes")   // <2>
    @Blocking             // <3>
    public Quote process(String quoteRequest) throws InterruptedException {
        // simulate some hard working task
        Thread.sleep(200);
        return new Quote(quoteRequest, random.nextInt(100));
    }
}

----
<1> Indicates that the method consumes the items from the `requests` channel.
<2> Indicates that the objects returned by the method are sent to the `quotes` channel.
<3> Indicates that the processing is _blocking_ and cannot be run on the caller thread.

For every Kafka _record_ from the `quote-requests` topic, Reactive Messaging calls the `process` method, and sends the returned `Quote` object to the `quotes` channel.
In this case, we need to configure the channel in the `application.properties` file, to configures the `requests` and `quotes` channels:

[source, properties]
----
%dev.quarkus.http.port=8081

# Configure the incoming `quote-requests` Kafka topic
mp.messaging.incoming.requests.topic=quote-requests
mp.messaging.incoming.requests.auto.offset.reset=earliest
----

Note that in this case we have one incoming and one outgoing connector configuration, each one distinctly named.
The configuration keys are structured as follows:

`mp.messaging.[outgoing|incoming].{channel-name}.property=value`

The `channel-name` segment must match the value set in the `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotation:

* `quote-requests` -> Kafka topic from which we read the quote requests
* `quotes` -> Kafka topic in which we write the quotes

[NOTE]
====
More details about this configuration is available on the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#producerconfigs[Producer configuration] and https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs[Consumer configuration] section from the Kafka documentation. These properties are configured with the prefix `kafka`.
An exhaustive list of configuration properties is available in xref:kafka.adoc#kafka-configuration[Kafka Reference Guide - Configuration].
====

`mp.messaging.incoming.requests.auto.offset.reset=earliest` instructs the application to start reading the topics from the first offset, when there is no committed offset for the consumer group.
In other words, it will also process messages sent before we start the processor application.

There is no need to set serializers or deserializers.
Quarkus detects them, and if none are found, generates them using JSON serialization.

== Receiving quotes

Back to our _producer_ project.
Let's modify the `QuotesResource` to consume quotes from Kafka and send them back to the client via Server-Sent Events:

[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;

...

@Channel("quotes")
Multi<Quote> quotes; // <1>

/**
 * Endpoint retrieving the "quotes" Kafka topic and sending the items to a server sent event.
 */
@GET
@Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS) // <2>
public Multi<Quote> stream() {
    return quotes; // <3>
}
----
<1> Injects the `quotes` channel using the `@Channel` qualifier
<2> Indicates that the content is sent using `Server Sent Events`
<3> Returns the stream (_Reactive Stream_)

No need to configure anything, as Quarkus will automatically associate the `quotes` channel to the `quotes` Kafka topic.
It will also generate a deserializer for the `Quote` class.

[TIP]
====
.Message serialization in Kafka
In this example we used Jackson to serialize/deserialize Kafka messages.
For more options on message serialization, see xref:kafka.adoc#kafka-serialization[Kafka Reference Guide - Serialization].

We strongly suggest adopting a contract-first approach using a schema registry.
To learn more about how to use Apache Kafka with the schema registry and Avro, follow the
xref:kafka-schema-registry-avro.adoc[Using Apache Kafka with Schema Registry and Avro] guide.
====

== The HTML page

Final touch, the HTML page requesting quotes and displaying the prices obtained over SSE.

Inside the _producer_ project, create the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/quotes.html` file with the following content:

[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Prices</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/patternfly/3.24.0/css/patternfly.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/patternfly/3.24.0/css/patternfly-additions.min.css">
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="card-title">Quotes</h2>
            <button class="btn btn-info" id="request-quote">Request Quote</button>
            <div class="quotes"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
</body>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script>
    $("#request-quote").click((event) => {
        fetch("/quotes/request", {method: "POST"})
        .then(res => res.text())
        .then(qid => {
            var row = $(`<h4 class='col-md-12' id='${qid}'>Quote # <i>${qid}</i> | <strong>Pending</strong></h4>`);
            $(".quotes").prepend(row);
        });
    });

    var source = new EventSource("/quotes");
    source.onmessage = (event) => {
      var json = JSON.parse(event.data);
      $(`#${json.id}`).html((index, html) => {
        return html.replace("Pending", `\$\xA0${json.price}`);
      });
    };
</script>
</html>
----

Nothing spectacular here.
When the user clicks the button, HTTP request is made to request a quote, and a pending quote is added to the list.
On each quote received over SSE, the corresponding item in the list is updated.

== Get it running

You just need to run both applications.
In one terminal, run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -f producer quarkus:dev
----

In another terminal, run:

[source, bash]
----
mvn -f processor quarkus:dev
----

Quarkus starts a Kafka broker automatically, configures the application and shares the Kafka broker instance between different applications.
See xref:kafka-dev-services.adoc[Dev Services for Kafka] for more details.

Open `http://localhost:8080/quotes.html` in your browser and request some quotes by clicking the button.

== Running in JVM or Native mode

When not running in dev or test mode, you will need to start your Kafka broker.
You can follow the instructions from the https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart[Apache Kafka website] or create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following content:

[source, yaml]

----

Make sure you first build both applications in JVM mode with:

[source, bash]
----
mvn -f producer package
mvn -f processor package
----

Once packaged, run `docker-compose up`.

NOTE: This is a development cluster, do not use in production.

You can also build and run our applications as native executables.
First, compile both applications as native:

[source, bash]
----
mvn -f producer package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
mvn -f processor package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
----

Run the system with:

[source, bash]
----
export QUARKUS_MODE=native
docker-compose up --build
----

== Going further

This guide has shown how you can interact with Kafka using Quarkus.
It utilizes https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging[SmallRye Reactive Messaging] to build data streaming applications.

For the exhaustive list of features and configuration options, check the xref:kafka.adoc[Reference guide for Apache Kafka Extension].

[NOTE]
====
In this guide we explore Smallrye Reactive Messaging framework to interact with Apache Kafka.
Quarkus extension for Kafka also allows
xref:kafka.adoc#kafka-bare-clients[using Kafka clients directly].
