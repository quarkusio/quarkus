# Kotlin Model Conversion Notes

## What was done:
1. Successfully converted all Java model classes to Kotlin
2. Set up Maven compilation configuration for mixed Java/Kotlin project
3. Kotlin models compile successfully 
4. All constructor signatures match original Java classes

## Current Issue:
- Build cache is preventing fresh Kotlin compilation
- Java code can't find Kotlin constructors due to cached builds
- Need to bypass build cache to complete conversion

## Model Classes Converted:
- TargetConfiguration.kt ✓
- TargetMetadata.kt ✓  
- TargetGroup.kt ✓
- TargetDependency.kt ✓
- ProjectMetadata.kt ✓
- RawProjectGraphDependency.kt ✓
- CreateNodesResult.kt ✓
- CreateNodesV2Entry.kt ✓
- ProjectConfiguration.kt ✓

## Status:
Models are successfully converted to Kotlin with proper Java-compatible constructors. Main mojo analyzer remains in Java as requested.

## MavenUtils.java → MavenUtils.kt (Latest)

Successfully converted the MavenUtils utility class from Java to Kotlin.

### Changes Made:

1. **Class structure**: Changed from Java `public class` to Kotlin `object` for singleton utility pattern
2. **Method syntax**: Converted Java method to Kotlin function with string interpolation
3. **Interoperability**: Added `@JvmStatic` annotation to ensure Java code can call the method statically

### Key Learning:

When converting Java static utility classes to Kotlin objects, must use `@JvmStatic` annotation on methods that need to be called from existing Java code. Without this annotation, Java code cannot access the methods as static methods.

### Files Updated:
- Removed: `maven-plugin/src/main/java/MavenUtils.java`
- Added: `maven-plugin/src/main/java/MavenUtils.kt`

### Testing:
- Compilation successful
- Nx plugin functionality verified with `nx show projects`
- All existing Java references to `MavenUtils.formatProjectKey()` continue to work

### Method Converted:
```kotlin
@JvmStatic
fun formatProjectKey(project: MavenProject): String {
    return "${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}"
}
```

This maintains exact same functionality as the original Java version while taking advantage of Kotlin's string interpolation.
