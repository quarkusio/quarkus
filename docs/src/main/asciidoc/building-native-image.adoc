= Quarkus - Building a Native Executable

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide covers:

* Compiling the application to a native executable
* Packaging the native executable in a container

This guide takes as input the application developed in the link:getting-started[Getting Started Guide].

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 8 installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* A xref:configuring-c-development[working C development environment]
* GraalVM version {graalvm-version} installed and xref:configuring-graalvm[configured appropriately]
* A working container runtime (Docker, podman)
* The code of the application developed in the link:getting-started[Getting Started Guide].

.Supporting native compilation in C
[[configuring-c-development]]
[NOTE]
====
What does having a working C developer environment mean?

* On Linux, you will need GCC, and the glibc and zlib headers. Examples for common distributions:
+
[source,shell]
----
# dnf (rpm-based)
sudo dnf install gcc glibc-devel zlib-devel libstdc++-static
# Debian-based distributions:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libz-dev zlib1g-dev
----
* XCode provides the required dependencies on macOS:
+
[source,shell]
----
xcode-select --install
----
* On Windows, you will need to install the https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_buildtools.exe[Visual Studio 2017 Visual C++ Build Tools]

=== Configuring GraalVM

[TIP]
====
If you cannot install GraalVM, you can use a multi-stage Docker build to run Maven inside a Docker container that embeds GraalVM. There is an explanation of how to do this at the end of this guide.
====

Version {graalvm-version} is required. Using the community edition is enough.

1. Install GraalVM if you haven't already. You have a few options for this:
** Use platform-specific install tools like https://github.com/graalvm/homebrew-tap[homebrew], https://sdkman.io/jdks#Oracle[sdkman], or https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Java[scoop].
** Download the appropriate Community Edition archive from <https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases>, and unpack it like you would any other JDK.
2. Configure the runtime environment. Set `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory, for example:
+
[source,shell]
----
export GRAALVM_HOME=$HOME/Development/graalvm/
----
+
On macOS, point the variable to the `Home` sub-directory:
+
[source,shell]
----
export GRAALVM_HOME=$HOME/Development/graalvm/Contents/Home/
----
+
On Windows, you will have to go through the Control Panel to set your environment variables.
+
[TIP]
====
Installing via scoop will do this for you.
====
3. Install the `native-image` tool using `gu install`:
+
[source,shell]
----
${GRAALVM_HOME}/bin/gu install native-image
----
+
Some previous releases of GraalVM included the `native-image` tool by default.  This is no longer the case; it must be installed as a second step after GraalVM itself is installed. Note: there is an outstanding issue xref:graal-and-catalina[using GraalVM with macOS Catalina].
4. (Optional) Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
export JAVA_HOME=${GRAALVM_HOME}
----
5. (Optional) Add the GraalVM `bin` directory to the path
+
[source,shell]
----
export PATH=${GRAALVM_HOME}/bin:$PATH
----

[[graal-and-catalina]]
.Issues using GraalVM with macOS Catalina
[NOTE]
====
GraalVM binaries are not (yet) notarized for macOS Catalina as reported in this https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1724[GraalVM issue]. This means that you may see the following error when using `gu`:

[source,shell]
----
“gu” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified
----

Use the following command to recursively delete the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute on the GraalVM install directory as a workaround:

[source,shell]
-----
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine $HOME/Development/graalvm/
-----
====

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and package the application step by step. However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `getting-started` directory.

== Producing a native executable

The native executable for our application will contain the application code, required libraries, Java APIs, and a reduced version of a VM. The smaller VM base improves the startup time of the application and produces a minimal disk footprint.

image:native-executable-process.png[Creating a native executable]

If you have generated the application from the previous tutorial, you can find in the `pom.xml` the following _profile_:

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>native</id>
        <properties>
            <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>
        </properties>
    </profile>
</profiles>
----

[TIP]
====
You can provide custom options for the `native-image` command using the `<quarkus.native.additional-build-args>` property.
Multiple options may be separated by a comma.

Another possibility is to include the `quarkus.native.additional-build-args` configuration property in your `application.properties`.

You can find more information about how to configure the native image building process in the <<configuration-reference>> section below.
====

We use a profile because, you will see very soon, packaging the native executable takes a _few_ minutes. You could
just pass -Dquarkus.package.type=native as a property on the command line, however it is better to use a profile as
this allows native image tests to also be run.

Create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

[[graal-and-windows]]
[NOTE]
.Issues with packaging on Windows
====
The Microsoft Native Tools for Visual Studio must first be initialized before packaging. You can do this by starting
the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt` that was installed with the Visual Studio Build Tools.

Another solution is to write a script to do this for you:

[source,shell]
----
cmd /c 'call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" && mvn package -Pnative'
----
====

In addition to the regular files, the build also produces `target/getting-started-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.
You can run it using: `./target/getting-started-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.

== Testing the native executable

Producing a native executable can lead to a few issues, and so it's also a good idea to run some tests against the application running in the native file.

In the `pom.xml` file, the `native` profile contains:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${surefire-plugin.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>integration-test</goal>
                <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <systemProperties>
                    <native.image.path>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}-runner</native.image.path>
                </systemProperties>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

This instructs the failsafe-maven-plugin to run integration-test and indicates the location of the produced native executable.

Then, open the `src/test/java/org/acme/quickstart/NativeGreetingResourceIT.java`. It contains:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.quickstart;


import io.quarkus.test.junit.NativeImageTest;

@NativeImageTest // <1>
public class NativeGreetingResourceIT extends GreetingResourceTest { // <2>

    // Run the same tests

}
----
<1> Use another test runner that starts the application from the native file before the tests.
The executable is retrieved using the `native.image.path` system property configured in the _Failsafe Maven Plugin_.
<2> We extend our previous tests, but you can also implement your tests

To see the `NativeGreetingResourceIT` run against the native executable, use `./mvnw verify -Pnative`:
[source,shell]
----
./mvnw verify -Pnative

----

[TIP]
====
By default, Quarkus waits for 60 seconds for the native image to start before automatically failing the native tests. This
duration can be changed using the `quarkus.test.native-image-wait-time` system property. For example, to increase the duration
to 300 seconds, use: `./mvnw verify -Pnative -Dquarkus.test.native-image-wait-time=300`.
====

By default, native tests runs using the `prod` profile.
This can be overridden using the `quarkus.test.native-image-profile` property.
For example, in your `application.properties` file, add: `quarkus.test.native-image-profile=test`.
Alternatively, you can run your tests with: `./mvnw verify -Pnative -Dquarkus.test.native-image-profile=test`.
However, don't forget that when the native executable is built the `prod` profile is enabled.
So, the profile you enable this way must be compatible with the produced executable.

=== Excluding tests when running as a native executable

When running tests this way, the only things that actually run natively are you application endpoints, which
you can only test via HTTP calls. Your test code does not actually run natively, so if you are testing code
that does not call your HTTP endpoints, it's probably not a good idea to run them as part of native tests.

If you share your test class between JVM and native executions like we advise above, you can mark certain tests
with the `@DisabledOnNativeImage` annotation in order to only run them on the JVM.


=== Testing an existing native executable

It is also possible to re-run the tests against a native executable that has already been built. To do this run
`./mvnw test-compile failsafe:integration-test`. This will discover the existing native image and run the tests against it using
failsafe.

If the process cannot find the native image for some reason, or you want to test a native image that is no longer in the
target directory you can specify the executable with the `-Dnative.image.path=` system property.

== Creating a container

IMPORTANT: Before going further, be sure to have a working container runtime (Docker, podman) environment.

You can run the application in a container using the JAR produced by the Quarkus Maven Plugin.
However, in this guide we focus on creating a container image using the produced native executable.

image:containerization-process.png[Containerization Process]

By default, the native executable is tailored for your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows etc).
Because the container may not use the same _executable_ format as the one produced by your operating system,
we will instruct the Maven build to produce an executable from inside a container:

[source, shell]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
----

[TIP]
====
You can also select the container runtime to use with:
[source,shell]
----
# Docker
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-runtime=docker
# Podman
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-runtime=podman
----

These are normal Quarkus config properties, so if you always want to build in a container
it is recommended you add these to your `application.properties` so you do not need to specify them every time.

====

The produced executable will be a 64 bit Linux executable, so depending on your operating system it may no longer be runnable.
However, it's not an issue as we are going to copy it to a container.
The project generation has provided a `Dockerfile.native` in the `src/main/docker` directory with the following content:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY target/*-runner /work/application
RUN chmod 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

[NOTE]
.Ubi?
====
The provided `Dockerfiles` use https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=overview#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi[UBI] (Universal Base Image) as parent image.
This base image has been tailored to work perfectly in containers.
The `Dockerfiles` use the https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal[_minimal_ version] of the base image to reduce the size of the produced image.

You can read more about UBI on:

* https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=overview#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi[the UBI image page]
* https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal[the _UBI-minimal_ image page]
* https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=tags#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal[the list of _UBI-minimal_ tags]
====

Then, if you didn't delete the generated native executable, you can build the docker image with:

[source,shell]
----
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t quarkus-quickstart/getting-started .
----

And finally, run it with:

[source,shell]
----
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus-quickstart/getting-started
----

NOTE: Interested by tiny Docker images, check the {quarkus-images-url}/master/distroless[distroless] version.

== Creating a container with a multi-stage Docker build

The previous section showed you how to build a native executable using Maven, but implicitly required that the proper GraalVM version be installed on the building machine (be it your local machine or your CI/CD infrastructure).

In cases where the GraalVM requirement cannot be met, you can use Docker to perform the Maven build by using a multi-stage Docker build. A multi-stage Docker build is like two Dockerfile files combined in one, the first is used to build the artifact used by the second.

In this guide we will use the first stage to generate the native executable using Maven and the second stage to create our runtime image.

[source,dockerfile,subs=attributes+]
----
## Stage 1 : build with maven builder image with native capabilities
FROM quay.io/quarkus/centos-quarkus-maven:{graalvm-flavor} AS build
COPY pom.xml /usr/src/app/
RUN mvn -f /usr/src/app/pom.xml -B de.qaware.maven:go-offline-maven-plugin:1.2.5:resolve-dependencies
COPY src /usr/src/app/src
USER root
RUN chown -R quarkus /usr/src/app
USER quarkus
RUN mvn -f /usr/src/app/pom.xml -Pnative clean package

## Stage 2 : create the docker final image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/target/*-runner /work/application
RUN chmod 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----


Save this file in `src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage` as it is not included in the getting started quickstart.

[WARNING]
====
Before launching our Docker build, we need to update the default `.dockerignore` file as it filters everything except the `target` directory and as we plan to build inside a container we need to be able to copy the `src` directory. So edit your `.dockerignore` and remove or comment its content.
====

[source,shell]
----
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage -t quarkus-quickstart/getting-started .
----

And finally, run it with:

[source,shell]
----
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus-quickstart/getting-started
----

[TIP]
====
If you need SSL support in your native executable, you can easily include the necessary libraries in your Docker image.

Please see link:native-and-ssl#working-with-containers[our Using SSL With Native Executables guide] for more information.
====

[[configuration-reference]]
== Configuring the Native Image

There are a lot of different configuration options that can affect how the native image is generated.
These are provided in `application.properties` the same as any other config property.

The properties are shown below:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-native-pkg-native-config.adoc[opts=optional]

== What's next?

This guide covered the creation of a native (binary) executable for your application.
It provides an application exhibiting a swift startup time and consuming less memory.
However, there is much more.

We recommend continuing the journey with the link:deploying-to-kubernetes[deployment to Kubernetes and OpenShift].
