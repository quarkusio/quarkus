= SmallRye Health

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can use https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-health/[SmallRye Health]
an implementation of the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/[MicroProfile Health] specification.

SmallRye Health allows applications to provide information about their state
to external viewers which is typically useful in cloud environments where automated 
processes must be able to determine whether the application should be discarded 
or restarted.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 11+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}

== Architecture

In this guide, we build a simple REST application that exposes MicroProfile Health 
functionalities at the `/q/health/live` and `/q/health/ready` endpoints according to the
specification.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the 
application step by step. However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an
{quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `microprofile-health-quickstart`
{quickstarts-tree-url}/microprofile-health-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=microprofile-health-quickstart \
    -Dextensions="smallrye-health"
cd microprofile-health-quickstart
----

This command generates a Maven project, importing the `smallrye-health` extension.

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `smallrye-health` extension
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="smallrye-health"
----

This will add the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-health</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Running the health check

Importing the `smallrye-health` extension directly exposes three REST endpoints:

- `/q/health/live` - The application is up and running.
- `/q/health/ready` - The application is ready to serve requests.
- `/q/health` - Accumulating all health check procedures in the application.
 
To check that the `smallrye-health` extension is working as expected:

* start your Quarkus application with `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev`
* access the `http://localhost:8080/q/health/live` endpoint using your browser or
`curl http://localhost:8080/q/health/live`

All of the health REST endpoints return a simple JSON object with two fields:

* `status` -- the overall result of all the health check procedures
* `checks` -- an array of individual checks

The general `status` of the health check is computed as a logical AND of all the 
declared health check procedures. The `checks` array is empty as we have not specified 
any health check procedure yet so let's define some.

== Creating your first health check

In this section, we create our first simple health check procedure.

Create the `org.acme.microprofile.health.SimpleHealthCheck` class:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.microprofile.health;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Liveness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped <1> <2>
public class SimpleHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("Simple health check");
    }
}
----
<1> It's recommended to annotate the health check class with `@ApplicationScoped` or the `@Singleton` scope so that a single bean instance is used for all health check requests. 
<2> If a bean class annotated with one of the health check annotations declares no scope then the `@Singleton` scope is used automatically.

As you can see, the health check procedures are defined as CDI beans that implement the `HealthCheck` interface and are annotated with one of the health check qualifiers, such as: 

- `@Liveness` - the liveness check accessible at `/q/health/live`
- `@Readiness` - the readiness check accessible at `/q/health/ready`

`HealthCheck` is a functional interface whose single method `call` returns a 
`HealthCheckResponse` object which can be easily constructed by the fluent builder 
API shown in the example.

As we have started our Quarkus application in dev mode simply repeat the request 
to `http://localhost:8080/q/health/live` by refreshing your browser window or by
using `curl http://localhost:8080/q/health/live`. Because we defined our health check
to be a liveness procedure (with `@Liveness` qualifier) the new health check procedure 
is now present in the `checks` array.

Congratulations! You've created your first Quarkus health check procedure. Let's 
continue by exploring what else can be done with SmallRye Health.

== Adding a readiness health check procedure

In the previous section, we created a simple liveness health check procedure which states 
whether our application is running or not. In this section, we will create a readiness 
health check which will be able to state whether our application is able to process 
requests.

We will create another health check procedure that simulates a connection to 
an external service provider such as a database. For starters, we will always return 
the response indicating the application is ready.

Create `org.acme.microprofile.health.DatabaseConnectionHealthCheck` class:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.microprofile.health;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Readiness
@ApplicationScoped
public class DatabaseConnectionHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up("Database connection health check");
    }
}

----

If you now rerun the health check at `http://localhost:8080/q/health/live` the `checks`
array will contain only the previously defined `SimpleHealthCheck` as it is the only 
check defined with the `@Liveness` qualifier. However, if you access 
`http://localhost:8080/q/health/ready` (in the browser or with
`curl http://localhost:8080/q/health/ready`) you will see only the
`Database connection health check` as it is the only health check defined with the 
`@Readiness` qualifier as the readiness health check procedure.

NOTE: If you access `http://localhost:8080/q/health` you will get back both checks.

More information about which health check procedures should be used in which situation 
is detailed in the MicroProfile Health specification. Generally, the liveness 
procedures determine whether the application should be restarted while readiness 
procedures determine whether it makes sense to contact the application with requests.

== Negative health check procedures

In this section, we extend our `Database connection health check` with the option of 
stating that our application is not ready to process requests as the underlying 
database connection cannot be established. For simplicity reasons, we only determine 
whether the database is accessible or not by a configuration property.

Update the `org.acme.microprofile.health.DatabaseConnectionHealthCheck` class:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.microprofile.health;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponseBuilder;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Readiness
@ApplicationScoped
public class DatabaseConnectionHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @ConfigProperty(name = "database.up", defaultValue = "false")
    private boolean databaseUp;

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {

        HealthCheckResponseBuilder responseBuilder = HealthCheckResponse.named("Database connection health check");

        try {
            simulateDatabaseConnectionVerification();
            responseBuilder.up();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // cannot access the database
            responseBuilder.down();
        }

        return responseBuilder.build();
    }

    private void simulateDatabaseConnectionVerification() {
        if (!databaseUp) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot contact database");
        }
    }
}
----

NOTE: Until now we used a simplified method of building a `HealthCheckResponse`
through the `HealthCheckResponse#up(String)` (there is also
`HealthCheckResponse#down(String)`) which will directly build the response object.
From now on, we utilize the full builder capabilities provided by the
`HealthCheckResponseBuilder` class.

If you now rerun the readiness health check (at `http://localhost:8080/q/health/ready`)
the overall `status` should be DOWN. You can also check the liveness check at 
`http://localhost:8080/q/health/live` which will return the overall `status` UP because
it isn't influenced by the readiness checks.

As we shouldn't leave this application with a readiness check in a DOWN state and 
because we are running Quarkus in dev mode you can add `database.up=true` in 
`src/main/resources/application.properties` and rerun the readiness health check again 
-- it should be up again.


== Adding user-specific data to the health check response

In previous sections, we saw how to create simple health checks with only the minimal 
attributes, namely, the health check name and its status (UP or DOWN). However, the 
MicroProfile Health specification also provides a way for the applications to supply
arbitrary data in the form of key-value pairs sent to the consuming end. This can be 
done by using the `withData(key, value)` method of the health check response 
builder API.

Let's create a new health check procedure `org.acme.microprofile.health.DataHealthCheck`:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.microprofile.health;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Liveness;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped
public class DataHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.named("Health check with data")
                .up()
                .withData("foo", "fooValue")
                .withData("bar", "barValue")
                .build();
    }
}
----

If you rerun the liveness health check procedure by accessing the `/q/health/live`
endpoint you can see that the new health check `Health check with data` is present 
in the `checks` array. This check contains a new attribute called `data` which is a 
JSON object consisting of the properties we have defined in our health check procedure.

This functionality is specifically useful in failure scenarios where you can pass the 
error along with the health check response.


[source,java]
----
        try {
            simulateDatabaseConnectionVerification();
            responseBuilder.up();
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            // cannot access the database
            responseBuilder.down()
                    .withData("error", e.getMessage()); // pass the exception message
        }
----

== Context propagation into the health check invocations

For the perfomance reasons the context (e.g., CDI or security context) is not propagated into each health check invocation. However, if you need to enable this functionality you can set the config property `quarkus.smallrye-health.context-propagation=true` to allow the context propagation into every health check call.

== Reactive health checks

MicroProfile Health currently doesn't support returning reactive types, but SmallRye Health does.

If you want to provide a reactive health check, you can implement the `io.smallrye.health.api.AsyncHealthCheck` interface instead of the `org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck` one.
The `io.smallrye.health.api.AsyncHealthCheck` interface allows you to return a `Uni<HealthCheckResponse>`.

The following example shows a reactive liveness check:

[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.health.api.AsyncHealthCheck;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Liveness;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped
public class LivenessAsync implements AsyncHealthCheck {

    @Override
    public Uni<HealthCheckResponse> call() {
        return Uni.createFrom().item(HealthCheckResponse.up("liveness-reactive"))
                .onItem().delayIt().by(Duration.ofMillis(10));
    }
}
----

== Extension health checks

Some extension may provide default health checks, including the extension will automatically register its health checks.

For example, `quarkus-agroal` that is used to manage Quarkus datasource(s) automatically register a readiness health check
that will validate each datasources: link:datasource#datasource-health-check[Datasource Health Check].

You can disable extension health check via the property `quarkus.health.extensions.enabled` so none will be automatically registered.

[[ui]]
== Health UI 

NOTE: Experimental - not included in the MicroProfile specification

`health-ui` allows you to see your Health Checks in a Web GUI.

The Quarkus `smallrye-health` extension ships with `health-ui` and enables it by default in dev and test modes, but it can also be explicitly configured for production mode as well.

`health-ui` can be accessed from http://localhost:8080/q/health-ui/ .

== Conclusion

SmallRye Health provides a way for your application to distribute information
about its healthiness state to state whether or not it is able to function properly. 
Liveness checks are utilized to tell whether the application should be restarted and 
readiness checks are used to tell whether the application is able to process requests. 

All that is needed to enable the SmallRye Health features in Quarkus is:

* adding the `smallrye-health` Quarkus extension to your project using the 
`quarkus-maven-plugin`: +
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="smallrye-health"
----

* or simply adding the following Maven dependency: +
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-health</artifactId>
</dependency>
