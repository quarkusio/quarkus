`quarkus.neo4j.authentication.disabled`:: Set this to true to disable authentication.

type: `boolean`; default value: `false`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.authentication.password`:: The password of the user connecting to the database.

type: `java.lang.String`; default value: `neo4j`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.authentication.username`:: The login of the user connecting to the database.

type: `java.lang.String`; default value: `neo4j`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.pool.connection-acquisition-timeout`:: Acquisition of new connections will be attempted for at most configured timeout.

type: `java.time.Duration`. _See duration note below_; default value: `1M`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.pool.idle-time-before-connection-test`:: Pooled connections that have been idle in the pool for longer than this timeout will be tested before they are used
again. The value {@literal 0} means connections will always be tested for validity and negative values mean
connections
will never be tested.

type: `java.time.Duration`. _See duration note below_; default value: `-0.001S`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.pool.log-leaked-sessions`:: Flag, if leaked sessions logging is enabled.

type: `boolean`; default value: `false`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.pool.max-connection-lifetime`:: Pooled connections older than this threshold will be closed and removed from the pool.

type: `java.time.Duration`. _See duration note below_; default value: `1H`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.pool.max-connection-pool-size`:: The maximum amount of connections in the connection pool towards a single database.

type: `int`; default value: `100`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.pool.metrics-enabled`:: Flag, if metrics are enabled.

type: `boolean`; default value: `false`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


`quarkus.neo4j.uri`:: The uri this driver should connect to. The driver supports bolt, bolt+routing or neo4j as schemes.

type: `java.lang.String`; default value: `bolt://localhost:7687`. The configuration is overridable at runtime. 


[NOTE]
====
The format for durations uses the standard `java.time.Duration` format.
You can learn more about it in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-[Duration#parse() javadoc].

You can also provide duration values starting with a number.
In this case, if the value consists only of a number, the converter treats the value as seconds.
Otherwise, `PT` is implicitly appended to the value to obtain a standard `java.time.Duration` format.
