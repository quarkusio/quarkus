# Maven Streaming Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented real-time log streaming for the Maven batch executor, allowing users to see Maven command output as it executes rather than waiting for completion.

## Implementation Details

### Previous Approach
- Used `execSync()` from Node.js `child_process`
- Blocking execution with no real-time feedback
- Large buffer allocation (10MB) to capture all output
- Users had to wait until completion to see any output

### New Streaming Approach
- Replaced `execSync()` with Nx's `PseudoTerminal` for professional streaming
- Real-time output streaming via `onOutput()` event handlers
- Maintained all existing functionality including JSON result parsing
- Automatic console output streaming for immediate feedback

### Key Changes Made

1. **Import Updates**: Added import for `createPseudoTerminal` from Nx
2. **New Streaming Function**: Created `executeWithStreaming()` function using PseudoTerminal
3. **Support Check Bypass**: Used `createPseudoTerminal(true)` to skip TTY requirement
4. **Async Implementation**: Used proper async/await pattern with `process.getResults()`
5. **Output Handling**: 
   - Collect output in `terminalOutput` for JSON parsing
   - Stream output to console automatically via PseudoTerminal
   - Handle process lifecycle asynchronously
6. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with try/catch blocks

### Benefits

- **Real-time Feedback**: Users see Maven output immediately as it executes
- **Better User Experience**: No more waiting for long-running Maven commands to complete
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing JSON parsing and result handling still works
- **Professional Integration**: Uses Nx's built-in PseudoTerminal for consistent behavior with other Nx executors

### Code Location

- File: `maven-plugin/src/executors/maven-batch/executor.ts`
- Function: `executeWithStreaming(command: string, cwd: string, verbose: boolean)`
- Usage: Automatically used by both single and multi-project batch executors

### Testing

Successfully tested with:
- `clean` goal on core project
- Real-time output streaming confirmed
- JSON result parsing working correctly
- All existing functionality preserved

## Technical Notes

### PseudoTerminal Support Issue

The initial implementation failed because `PseudoTerminal.isSupported()` requires `process.stdout.isTTY` to be true. In non-TTY environments (like our executor context), this check fails even though PseudoTerminal works fine.

**Solution**: Use `createPseudoTerminal(true)` with `skipSupportCheck=true` to bypass the TTY requirement.

### Command Execution

PseudoTerminal handles command execution seamlessly:
1. Initialize terminal with `await pseudoTerminal.init()`
2. Pass the full command string to `runCommand()`
3. Set `quiet: false` to enable output streaming
4. Set `tty: false` since we don't need terminal emulation
5. Wait for completion with `await process.getResults()`

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling for:
- PseudoTerminal creation failures
- Terminal initialization failures
- Non-zero exit codes
- Process errors
- Output parsing failures (preserved from original implementation)

## Usage

No changes required for end users - streaming is now enabled by default for all Maven batch executions. The executor maintains the same interface and behavior while providing real-time output streaming.
