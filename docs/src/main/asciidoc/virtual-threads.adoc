This guide explains how to benefit from Java 19+ virtual threads in Quarkus application.

== What are virtual threads?

=== Terminology
OS thread::
A "thread-like" data structure managed by the Operating System.

Platform thread::
Until Java 19, every instance of the link:{thread}[Thread] class was a platform thread, a wrapper around an OS thread.
Creating a platform thread creates an OS thread, and blocking a platform thread blocks an OS thread.

Virtual thread::
Lightweight, JVM-managed threads. They extend the link:{thread}[Thread] class but are not tied to one specific OS thread.
Thus, scheduling virtual threads is the responsibility of the JVM.

Carrier thread::
A platform thread used to execute a virtual thread is called a **carrier** thread.
It isn't a class distinct from link:{Thread}[Thread] or `VirtualThread` but rather a functional denomination.

=== Differences between virtual threads and platform threads
We will give a brief overview of the topic here; please refer to the link:{vthreadjep}[JEP 425] for more information.

Virtual threads are a feature available since Java 19, aiming at providing a cheap alternative to platform threads for I/O-bound workloads.

Until now, platform threads were the concurrency unit of the JVM.
They are a wrapper over OS structures.
Creating a Java platform thread creates a "thread-like" structure in your operating system.

Virtual threads, on the other hand, are managed by the JVM. To be executed, they need to be mounted on a platform thread (which acts as a carrier to that virtual thread).
As such, they have been designed to offer the following characteristics:

Lightweight :: Virtual threads occupy less space than platform threads in memory.
Hence, it becomes possible to use more virtual threads than platform threads simultaneously without blowing up the memory.
By default, platform threads are created with a stack of about 1 MB, whereas virtual threads stack is "pay-as-you-go."
You can find these numbers and other motivations for virtual threads in this https://youtu.be/lIq-x_iI-kc?t=543[presentation] given by the lead developer of project Loom (the project that added the virtual thread support to the JVM).

Cheap to create:: Creating a platform thread in Java takes time.
Currently, techniques such as pooling, where threads are created once and then reused, are strongly encouraged to minimize the time lost in starting them (as well as limiting the maximum number of threads to keep memory consumption low).
Virtual threads are supposed to be disposable entities that we create when we need them,
it is discouraged to pool them or reuse them for different tasks.

Cheap to block:: When performing blocking I/O, the underlying OS thread wrapped by the Java platform thread is put in a wait queue, and a context switch occurs to load a new thread context onto the CPU core. This operation takes time.
Since the JVM manages virtual threads, no underlying OS thread is blocked when they perform a blocking operation.
Their state is stored in the heap, and another virtual thread is executed on the same Java platform (carrier) thread.

=== The Continuation Dance
As mentioned above, the JVM schedules the virtual threads. These virtual threads are mounted on carrier threads. The scheduling comes with a pinch of magic. When the virtual thread attempts to use blocking I/O, the JVM _transforms_ this call into a non-blocking one, unmounts the virtual thread, and mounts another virtual thread on the carrier thread. When the I/O completes, the _waiting_ virtual thread becomes eligible again and will be re-mounted on a carrier thread to continue its execution. For the user, all this dance is invisible. Your synchronous code is executed asynchronously.

Note that the virtual thread may not be re-mounted on the same carrier thread.

[[cpu-bound]]
=== Virtual threads are useful for I/O-bound workloads only
We now know we can create more virtual threads than platform threads. One could be tempted to use virtual threads to perform long computations (CPU-bound workload).
It is useless and counterproductive.
CPU-bound doesn't consist of quickly swapping threads while they need to wait for the completion of an I/O, but in leaving
them attached to a CPU core to compute something.
In this scenario, it is worse than useless to have thousands of threads if we have tens of CPU cores, virtual threads won't enhance the performance of CPU-bound workloads.
Even worse, when running a CPU-bound workload on a virtual thread, the virtual thread monopolizes the carrier thread on which it is mounted.
It will either reduce the chance for the other virtual thread to run or will start creating new carrier threads, leading to high memory usage.

== Run code on virtual threads using @RunOnVirtualThread

In Quarkus, the support of virtual thread is implemented using the link:{runonvthread}[@RunOnVirtualThread] annotation.
This section briefly overviews the rationale and how to use it.
There are dedicated guides for extensions supporting that annotation, such as // TODO.

[[why-not]]
=== Why not run everything on virtual threads?
As mentioned above, not everything can run safely on virtual threads.
The risk of **monopolization** can lead to high-memory usage.
Also, there are situations where the virtual thread cannot be unmounted from the carrier thread.
This is called **pinning**.
Finally, some libraries use `ThreadLocal` to store and reuse objects.
Using virtual threads with these libraries will lead to massive allocation, as the intentionally pooled objects will be instantiated for every (disposable and generally short-lived) virtual thread.

As of today, it is not possible to use virtual threads in a carefree manner.
Following such a laissez-faire approach could quickly lead to memory and resource starvation issues.
Thus, Quarkus uses an explicit model until the aforementioned issues disappear (as the Java ecosystem matures).
It is also the reason why _reactive_ extensions have the virtual thread support, and rarely the _classic_ ones.
We need to know when to dispatch on a virtual thread.

It is essential to understand that these issues are not Quarkus limitations or bugs but are due to the current state of the Java ecosystem which needs to evolve to become virtual thread friendly.

NOTE: To learn more about the internal design and choices, check the https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583678.3596895[Considerations for integrating virtual threads in a Java framework: a Quarkus example in a resource-constrained environment] paper.

[[monopolization]]
==== Monopolization cases
The monopolization has been explained in the xref:cpu-bound[Virtual threads are useful for I/O-bound workloads only] section.
When running long computations, we do not allow the JVM to unmount and switch to another virtual thread until the virtual thread terminates.
Indeed, the current scheduler does not support preempting tasks.

This monopolization can lead to the creation of new carrier threads to execute other virtual threads.
Creating carrier threads results in creating platform threads.
So, there is a memory cost associated with this creation.

Suppose you run in a constrained environment, such as containers. In that case, monopolization can quickly become a concern, as the high memory usage can lead to out-of-memory issues and container termination.
The memory usage may be higher than with regular worker threads because of the inherent cost of the scheduling and virtual threads.

[[pinning]]
==== Pinning cases
The promise of "cheap blocking" might not always hold: a virtual thread might _pin_ its carrier on certain occasions.
The platform thread is blocked in this situation, precisely as it would have been in a typical blocking scenario.

According to link:{vthreadjep}[JEP 425] this can happen in two situations:

- when a virtual thread performs a blocking operation inside a `synchronized` block or method
- when it executes a blocking operation inside a native method or a foreign function

It can be reasonably easy to avoid these situations in your code, but verifying every dependency you use is hard.
Typically, while experimenting with virtual threads, we realized that old versions of the link:{pgsql-driver}[postgresql-JDBC driver]
results in frequent pinning.
Most JDBC drivers still pin the carrier thread.
Even worse, lots of widespread libraries are pinning and would require code changes.

[[pooling]]
==== The pooling case
Some libraries are using `ThreadLocal` as an object pooling mechanism.
Extremely popular libraries like https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/919[Jackson] and Netty assume that the application uses a limited number of threads, which are recycled (using a thread pool) to run multiple (unrelated but sequential) tasks.

This pattern has multiple advantages, such as:

- Allocation benefit: heavy objects are only allocated once per thread, but because the number of these threads was intended to be limited, it would not use too much memory.
- Thread safety: only one thread can access the object stored in the thread local - preventing concurrent accesses.

However, this pattern is counter-productive when using virtual threads.
Virtual threads are not pooled and generally short-lived.
So, instead of a few of them, we now have many of them.
For each of them, the object stored in the `ThreadLocal` is created (often large and expensive) and won't be reused, as the virtual thread is not pooled (and won't be used to run another task once the execution completes).
This problem leads to high memory usage.
Unfortunately, it requires sophisticated code changes in the libraries themselves.

=== Use @RunVirtualThread with RESTEasy Reactive

This section shows a brief example of using the link:{runonvthread}[@RunOnVirtualThread] annotation.
It also explains the various development and execution models offered by Quarkus.

The `@RunOnVirtualThread` annotation instructs Quarkus to invoke the annotated method on a **new** virtual thread instead of the current one.
Quarkus handles the creation of the virtual thread and the offloading.

Since virtual threads are disposable entities, the fundamental idea of `@RunOnVirtualThread` is to offload the execution of an endpoint handler on a new virtual thread instead of running it on an event-loop or worker thread (in the case of RESTEasy Reactive).

To do so, it suffices to add the link:{runonvthread}[@RunOnVirtualThread] annotation to the endpoint.
If the Java Virtual Machine used to **run** the application provides virtual thread support (so, Java 19 or later versions), then the endpoint execution is offloaded to a virtual thread.
It will then be possible to perform blocking operations without blocking the platform thread upon which the virtual thread is mounted.

In the case of RESTEasy Reactive, this annotation can only be used on endpoints annotated with link:{blockingannotation}[@Blocking] or
considered blocking because of their signature.
You can visit xref:resteasy-reactive.adoc#execution-model-blocking-non-blocking[Execution model, blocking, non-blocking]
for more information.

==== Get started with virtual threads with RESTEasy Reactive

Add the following dependency to your build file:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy-reactive</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive")
----

Then, you also need to make sure that you are using the version 19+ of Java, this can be enforced in your pom.xml file with the following:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>19</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>19</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
----

Finally, until Java 21, you need to configure your compiler plugin with the `--enable-preview` flag.
If you use Maven, make sure that the configuration of the Maven compiler plugin is the following:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${compiler-plugin.version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <compilerArgs>
      <arg>--enable-preview</arg>
      <arg>-parameters</arg>
    </compilerArgs>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

==== Three development and execution models

The example below shows the differences between three endpoints, all of them querying a _fortune_ in the database then
returning it to the client.

- the first one uses the traditional blocking style, it is considered blocking due to its signature.
- the second one uses Mutiny, it is considered non-blocking due to its signature.
- the third one uses Mutiny but in a synchronous way, since it doesn't return a "reactive type" it is
considered blocking and the link:{runonvthread}[@RunOnVirtualThread] annotation can be used.

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.rest;

import org.acme.fortune.model.Fortune;
import org.acme.fortune.repository.FortuneRepository;
import io.smallrye.common.annotation.RunOnVirtualThread;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;


@Path("")
public class FortuneResource {

    @Inject FortuneRepository repository;

    @GET
    @Path("/blocking")
    public Fortune blocking() {
        // Runs on a worker (platform) thread
        var list = repository.findAllBlocking();
        return pickOne(list);
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/reactive")
    public Uni<Fortune> reactive() {
        // Runs on the event loop
        return repository.findAllAsync()
                .map(this::pickOne);
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/virtual")
    @RunOnVirtualThread
    public Fortune virtualThread() {
        // Runs on a virtual thread
        var list = repository.findAllAsyncAndAwait();
        return pickOne(list);
    }

}
----

The following table summarizes the options:

|===
|Model |Example of signature |Pros |Cons

|Synchronous code on worker thread
|`Fortune blocking()`
|Simple code
|Use worker thread (limit concurrency)

|Reactive code on event loop
|`Uni<Fortune> reactive()`
|High concurrency and low resource usage
|More complex code

|Synchronous code on virtual thread
|`@RunOnVirtualThread Fortune vt()`
|Simple code
|Risk of pinning, monopolization and under-efficient object pooling
|===

Note that all three models can be used in a single application.

== Use virtual thread friendly clients

As mentioned in the href:why-not[Why not run everything on virtual threads?] section, the Java ecosystem is not entirely ready for virtual threads.
So, you need to be careful, especially when using a libraries doing I/O.

Fortunately, Quarkus provides a massive ecosystem that is ready to be used in virtual threads.
Mutiny, the reactive programming library used in Quarkus, and the Vert.x Mutiny bindings provides the ability to write blocking code (so, no fear, no learning curve) which do not pin the carrier thread.

As a result:

1. Quarkus extensions providing blocking APIs on top of reactive APIs can be used in virtual threads.
This includes the reactive rest client, the redis client, the mailer...
2. API returning `Uni` can be used directly using `uni.await().atMost(...)`. It blocks the virtual thread, without blocking the carrier thread, and also improves the resilience of your application with an easy (non-blocking) timeout support.
3. If you use a https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny-vertx-bindings/latest/[Vert.x client using the Mutiny bindings], use the `andAwait()` methods which block until you get the result without pinning the carrier thread. It includes all the reactive SQL drivers.

== Detect pinned thread in tests

We recommend to use the following configuration when running tests in application using virtual threads.
If would not fail the tests, but at least dump start traces if the code pins the carrier thread:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${surefire-plugin.version}</version>
  <configuration>
      <systemPropertyVariables>
        <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>
        <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>
      </systemPropertyVariables>
      <argLine>--enable-preview -Djdk.tracePinnedThreads</argLine>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

NOTE: The `--enable-preview` flag is not necessary with Java 21.

== Run application using virtual threads

Prior to Java 21, virtual threads are still an experimental feature, you need to start your application with the `--enable-preview` flag:

[source, bash]
----
java --enable-preview -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

== Build containers for application using virtual threads

When running your application in JVM mode (so not compiled into native, for native check xref:native[the dedicated section]), you can follow the xref:./container-image.adoc[containerization guide] to build a container.

In this section, we use JIB to build the container.
Refer to the xref:./container-image.adoc[containerization guide] to learn more about the alternatives.

To containerize your Quarkus application that use `@RunOnVirtualThread`, add the following properties in your `application.properties`:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.container-image.build=true
quarkus.container-image.group=<your-group-name>
quarkus.container-image.name=<you-container-name>
quarkus.jib.base-jvm-image=eclipse-temurin:20.0.1_9-jre-ubi9-minimal <1>
quarkus.jib.platforms=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 <2>
quarkus.jib.jvm-arguments=--enable-preview <3>
----
<1> Make sure you use a base image supporting virtual threads. Here we use an image providing Java 20.
<2> Select the target architecture. You can select more than one to build multi-archs images.
<3> Don't forget to use the `--enable-preview` flag if you are not using Java 21+.

Then, build your container as you would do usually.
For example, if you are using Maven, run:

[source, bash]
----
mvn package
----

[[native]]
== Compiling Quarkus application using virtual threads into native executable

=== Using a local GraalVM installation

To compile a Quarkus applications leveraging `@RunOnVirtualThreads` into native executable, you must be sure to use a GraalVM / Mandrel `native-image` supporting virtual threads, so providing at least Java 19+.

Then, until Java 21, you need to add the following property to your `application.properties` file:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.native.additional-build-args=--enable-preview
----

Build the native executable as indicated on xref:./building-native-image.adoc[the native compilation guide].
For example, with Maven, run:

[source, bash]
----
mvn package -Dnative
----

=== Using an in-container build

In-container build allows building Linux 64 executables by using a `native-image` compiler running in a container.
It avoids having to install `native-image` on your machine, and also allows configuring the GraalVM version you need.
Note that, to use in-container build, you must have Docker or Podman installed on your machine.

Then, add to your `application.properties` file:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.native.additional-build-args=--enable-preview <1>

# In-container build to get a linux 64 executable
quarkus.native.container-build=true <2>
quarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel-builder-image:jdk-20 <3>
----
<1> The `enable-preview` flag in only necessary until Java 21.
<2> Enables the in-container build
<3> The builder container to use. Make sure it supports virtual threads

[IMPORTANT]
.From ARM/64 to AMD/64
====
If you are using a Mac M1 or M2 (using an ARM64 CPU), you need to be aware that the native executable you will get using an in-container build will be a Linux executable, but using your host (ARM 64) architecture.
You can use emulation to force the architecture when using Docker with the following property:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.native.container-runtime-options=--platform=linux/amd64
----

Be aware that it increases the compilation time... a lot (>10 minutes).
====

=== Containerize native applications using virtual threads

To build a container running a Quarkus application using virtual threads compiled into a native executable, you must
make sure you have a Linux/AMD64 executable (or ARM64 if you are targeting ARM machines).

Make sure your `application.properties` contains the configuration explained in xref:native[the native compilation section].

Then, build your container as you would do usually.
For example, if you are using Maven, run:

[source, bash]
----
mvn package -Dnative
----

NOTE: If you ever want to build a native container image and already have an existing native image you can set `-Dquarkus.native.reuse-existing=true` and the native image build will not be re-run.

== Use the duplicated context in virtual threads

Methods annotated with `@RunOnVirtualThread` inherit from the original duplicated context (See the xref:duplicated-context.adoc[duplicated context reference guide] for details).
So, the data written in the duplicated context (and the request scope, as the request scoped is stored in the duplicated context) by filters and interceptors are available during the method execution (even if the filters and interceptors are not run on the virtual thread).

However, thread locals are not propagated.

== Virtual thread names

Virtual threads are created without a thread name by default, which is not practical to identify the execution for debugging and logging purposes.
Quarkus managed virtual threads are named and prefixed with `quarkus-virtual-thread-`.
You can customize this prefix, or disable the naming altogether configuring an empty value:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.virtual-threads.name-prefix=

----
