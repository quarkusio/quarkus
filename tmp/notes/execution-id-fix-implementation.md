# Execution ID Fix Implementation Progress

## Problem
Maven enforcer plugin targets were being generated without execution ID suffixes, causing failures:
- Generated: `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-enforcer-plugin:enforce` (fails)  
- Required: `org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-enforcer-plugin:enforce@enforce` (works)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated TargetGenerationService.kt
- Modified `createGoalTarget()` method to include execution ID in goal string:
```kotlin
val goalWithExecution = if (execution.id != null && execution.id.isNotEmpty()) {
    "$pluginKey:$goal@${execution.id}"
} else {
    "$pluginKey:$goal"
}
```

### 2. Updated ExecutionPlanAnalysisService.kt  
- Added 3-parameter version of `getTargetName()`:
```kotlin
fun getTargetName(artifactId: String?, goal: String, executionId: String?): String {
    val pluginName = normalizePluginName(artifactId)
    return if (executionId != null && executionId.isNotEmpty()) {
        "$pluginName:$goal@$executionId"
    } else {
        "$pluginName:$goal"
    }
}
```

### 3. Updated target name generation in TargetGenerationService.kt
- Line 185 now calls 3-parameter version:
```kotlin
val targetName = ExecutionPlanAnalysisService.getTargetName(plugin.artifactId, goal, execution.id)
```

## Build Cache Issue
The Develocity build cache is preventing changes from taking effect despite multiple compilation attempts with various cache-busting techniques. The bytecode shows old method signatures.

## Next Steps
1. Find way to bypass build cache completely
2. Test changes take effect in generated targets
3. Verify `nx validate build-parent` works with execution ID suffixes
