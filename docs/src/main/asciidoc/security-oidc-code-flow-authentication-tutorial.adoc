= Protect a web application by using OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization code flow
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: security,web

With the Quarkus OpenID Connect (OIDC) extension, you can protect application HTTP endpoints by using the OIDC Authorization Code Flow mechanism.

To learn more about the OIDC authorization code flow mechanism, see xref:security-oidc-code-flow-authentication-concept.adoc[OIDC code flow mechanism for protecting web applications].
To learn about how well-known social providers such as Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Twitter, Apple, Facebook, and Spotify can be used with Quarkus OIDC, see xref:security-openid-connect-providers.adoc[Configuring Well-Known OpenID Connect Providers].
See also, xref:security-authentication-mechanisms-concept.adoc#other-supported-authentication-mechanisms[Authentication mechanisms in Quarkus].

== Prerequisites

:prerequisites-docker:
include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]

== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple web application with a single page:

* `/index.html`

This page is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart[directory].

== Procedure

=== Create the Maven project

First, we need a new project.
Create a new project with the following command:

:create-app-artifact-id: security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart
:create-app-extensions: resteasy-reactive,oidc
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `oidc` extension to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

:add-extension-extensions: oidc
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

This will add the following to your build file:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
   <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-oidc")
----

=== Write the application

Let's write a simple Jakarta REST resource which has all the tokens returned in the authorization code grant response injected:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.openid.connect.web.authentication;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;

import io.quarkus.oidc.IdToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.RefreshToken;

@Path("/tokens")
public class TokenResource {

   /**
    * Injection point for the ID Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
    */
   @Inject
   @IdToken
   JsonWebToken idToken;

   /**
    * Injection point for the Access Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
    */
   @Inject
   JsonWebToken accessToken;

   /**
    * Injection point for the Refresh Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
    */
   @Inject
   RefreshToken refreshToken;

   /**
    * Returns the tokens available to the application. This endpoint exists only for demonstration purposes, you should not
    * expose these tokens in a real application.
    *
    * @return a HTML page containing the tokens available to the application
    */
   @GET
   @Produces("text/html")
   public String getTokens() {
       StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder().append("<html>")
               .append("<body>")
               .append("<ul>");


       Object userName = this.idToken.getClaim("preferred_username");

       if (userName != null) {
           response.append("<li>username: ").append(userName.toString()).append("</li>");
       }

       Object scopes = this.accessToken.getClaim("scope");

       if (scopes != null) {
           response.append("<li>scopes: ").append(scopes.toString()).append("</li>");
       }

       response.append("<li>refresh_token: ").append(refreshToken.getToken() != null).append("</li>");

       return response.append("</ul>").append("</body>").append("</html>").toString();
   }
}
----

This endpoint has ID, access, and refresh tokens injected.
It returns a `preferred_username` claim from the ID token, a `scope` claim from the access token, and also a refresh token availability status.

Note that you do not have to inject the tokens - it is only required if the endpoint needs to use the ID token to interact with the currently authenticated user or use the access token to access a downstream service on behalf of this user.

// SJ: TO DO - update link to point to new reference guide. For more information, see <<access_id_and_access_tokens,Access ID and Access Tokens>> section.

=== Configure the application

The OIDC extension allows you to define the configuration using the `application.properties` file which should be located at the `src/main/resources` directory.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated
----

This is the simplest configuration you can have when enabling authentication to your application.

The `quarkus.oidc.client-id` property references the `client_id` issued by the OIDC provider and the `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret` property sets the client secret.

The `quarkus.oidc.application-type` property is set to `web-app` in order to tell Quarkus that you want to enable the OIDC authorization code flow, so that your users are redirected to the OIDC provider to authenticate.

Finally, the `quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated` permission is set to tell Quarkus about the paths you want to protect.
In this case, all paths are being protected by a policy that ensures that only `authenticated` users are allowed to access.
For more information, see xref:security-authorization-of-web-endpoints-reference.adoc[Security Authorization Guide].

=== Start and configure the Keycloak server

To start a Keycloak server, use Docker and run the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin -p 8180:8080 quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:{keycloak.version} start-dev
----

where `keycloak.version` should be set to `17.0.0` or higher.

You should be able to access your Keycloak Server at http://localhost:8180[localhost:8180].

To access the Keycloak Administration Console, log in as the `admin` user.
Username should be `admin` and password `admin`.

Import the {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] to create a new realm.
For more information, see the Keycloak documentation about how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_create-realm[create a new realm].

=== Run the application in dev and JVM modes

To run the application in a dev mode, use:

include::{includes}/devtools/dev.adoc[]

When you're done playing with dev mode, you can run it as a standard Java application.

First, compile it:

include::{includes}/devtools/build.adoc[]

Then, run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

=== Run the application in Native mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code.
No modifications are required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your production environment, as the runtime technology is included in
the produced binary, and optimized to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compilation will take a bit longer, so this step is disabled by default.
You can build again by enabling the native build:

include::{includes}/devtools/build-native.adoc[]

After getting a cup of coffee, you can run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart-runner
----

=== Test the application

To test the application, open your browser and access the following URL:


* http://localhost:8080/tokens[http://localhost:8080/tokens]

If everything is working as expected, you are redirected to the Keycloak server to authenticate.

To authenticate to the application, type the following credentials when at the Keycloak login page:

* Username: *alice*
* Password: *alice*

After clicking the `Login` button, you are redirected back to the application.

For more information about writing the integration tests that depend on `Dev Services for Keycloak`, see the <<security-oidc-code-flow-authentication-concept.adoc#integration-testing-keycloak-devservices, Dev Services for Keycloak>> section.
