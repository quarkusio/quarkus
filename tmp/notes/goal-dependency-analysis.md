# Goal Dependency Analysis

## ✅ **What's Working**

### Goal Assignment Fixed
- `maven-compiler:compile` now properly assigned to `compile` phase 
- `maven-compiler:testCompile` now properly assigned to `test-compile` phase
- Quarkus goals properly distributed across phases:
  - `serve` → `compile` phase
  - `quarkus:test` → `test` phase  
  - `build`, `quarkus:generate-code` → `package` phase

### Missing Phases Added
- `addMissingPhasesForGoals()` successfully adds `test-compile` phase when needed
- Phase dependencies correctly updated for new phases

## ❌ **What's Not Working**

### Goal-to-Goal Dependencies Empty
- `goalDependencies` field is empty for all projects
- Expected: goals should depend on goals from prerequisite phases
- Example: `serve` goal should depend on goals in `validate` phase (if any)

## 🔍 **Root Cause Investigation**

### Possible Issues in `generateGoalDependencies()`

1. **No Goals in Prerequisite Phases**: 
   - Most projects have empty goals in prerequisite phases
   - Example: `validate` phase typically has no goals, so `compile` phase goals have no dependencies

2. **Phase Dependency Chain**:
   - `compile` depends on `process-resources` (which has no goals)
   - `test` depends on `process-test-classes` (which has no goals)
   - Need to traverse full dependency chain to find actual goals

3. **Logic Issue**: 
   - Code only looks at immediate prerequisite phases
   - Should traverse the full phase dependency chain to find the first phase with actual goals

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### Goal Dependencies Should Be:
- `serve` (in compile) → depends on any goals in `validate` phase
- `build` (in package) → depends on goals in `test`, `test-compile`, `compile`, `validate` phases
- `quarkus:test` (in test) → depends on goals in `test-compile`, `compile`, `validate` phases

## 📋 **Solution Strategy**

1. **Modify `generateGoalDependencies()`** to traverse the full phase dependency chain
2. **Find First Phase with Goals** rather than just immediate prerequisites  
3. **Test with projects** that have goals in multiple phases

The goal assignment fix is working perfectly. The issue is in the goal dependency generation logic.
