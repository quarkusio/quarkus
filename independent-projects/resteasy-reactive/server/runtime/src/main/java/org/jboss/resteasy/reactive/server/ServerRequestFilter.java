/**
 * When used on a method, then an implementation of {@link jakarta.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestFilter} is generated
 * that calls the annotated method with the proper arguments
 * <p>
 * The idea behind using this is to make it much to write a {@code ServerRequestFilter} as all the necessary information
 * is passed as arguments to the method instead of forcing the author to use a mix of {@code @Context} and programmatic CDI
 * look-ups.
 * <p>
 * An example filter could look like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class CustomContainerRequestFilter {
 *
 *     private final SomeBean someBean;
 *
 *     // SomeBean will be automatically injected by CDI as long as SomeBean is a bean itself
 *     public CustomContainerRequestFilter(SomeBean someBean) {
 *         this.someBean = someBean;
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;ServerRequestFilter
 *     public void whatever(UriInfo uriInfo, HttpHeaders httpHeaders) {
 *         // do something
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Methods annotated with {@code ServerRequestFilter} can declare any of the following parameters (in any order)
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ContainerRequestContext}
 * <li>{@link UriInfo}
 * <li>{@link HttpHeaders}
 * <li>{@link Request}
 * <li>{@link ResourceInfo}
 * <li>{@link SimpleResourceInfo}
 * </ul>
 *
 * The return type of the method must be either be of type {@code void}, {@code Response}, {@code RestResponse},
 * {@code Optional<Response>}, {@code Optional<RestResponse>},
 * {@code Uni<Void>}, {@code Uni<Response>} or
 * {@code Uni<RestResponse>}.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code void} should be used when filtering does not need to perform any blocking operations and the filter cannot abort
 * processing.
 * <li>{@code Response} or {@code RestResponse} should be used when filtering does not need to perform any blocking operations
 * and the filter cannot
 * abort
 * processing - in this case the processing will be aborted if the response is not {@code null}.
 * <li>{@code Optional<Response>} or {@code Optional<RestResponse>} should be used when filtering does not need to perform any
 * blocking operations but the filter
 * might abort processing - in this case processing is aborted when the {@code Optional} contains a {@code Response} payload.
 * <li>{@code Uni<Void>} should be used when filtering needs to perform a non-blocking operation but the filter cannot abort
 * processing.
 * Note that {@code Uni<Void>} can easily be produced using: {@code Uni.createFrom().nullItem()}
 * <li>{@code Uni<Response>} or {@code Uni<RestResponse>} should be used when filtering needs to perform a non-blocking
 * operation
 * and the filter
 * might abort processing - in this case processing is aborted when the {@code Uni} contains a {@code Response} payload.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Another important thing to note is that if {@link ContainerRequestContext} is used as a request parameter, calling
 * {@code abortWith}
 * is not allowed. You should use the proper response type if aborting processing is necessary.
