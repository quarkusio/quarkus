= Quarkus - Deploying on Google cloud platform

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide covers:

Connecting to a CloudSQL postgresql instance with quarkus-agroal and service account using CloudRun

== Prerequisites

For this guide you need:

* roughly 1 hour
* having access to an Google cloud platform project with owner rights.

This guide will take as input an application developed in the link:datasource[datasource guide].

Make sure you have the application at hand working locally.


== Solution

We recommend to follow the instructions in the next sections and build the application step by step.

== Connecting to CloudSQL

Google CloudSQL managed service allows 4 kinds of connection :

. Using public IP
. Using private IP
. Using Cloud SQL Proxy
. Using service account

The first two don't need more details, simply connect to your database following the link:datasource[datasource guide].
The third allows you to connect as if locally, but is not available for AppEngine or CloudRun where you only deploy one artifact.
Please check link:https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/external-connection-methods?hl=en[Connection options for external applications].

This guide will help you through the fourth possibility : connecting using service account.

== Adding necessary dependencies to your application.

You will need to add the _Cloud SQL Postgres Socket Factory_ and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver extension.

.Example dependencies using Maven
[source,xml, subs="attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.cloud.sql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgres-socket-factory</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.15</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-jdbc-postgresql</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Configuring the CloudSQL instance

If you haven't already please follow the link:https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-instance[Creating instances guide].

Ensure you have a service account with _Cloud SQL Client_ role (minimum necessary role), and get your instance connection name (`PROJECT_ID:REGION:INSTANCE_ID`).

== Configuring the application

Configure your quarkus application as follows :

[source,properties]
--
quarkus.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql:///${DB_NAME}
quarkus.datasource.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
quarkus.datasource.username = ${DB_USER}
quarkus.datasource.password = ${DB_PASSWORD}
quarkus.datasource.socket-factory=com.google.cloud.sql.postgres.SocketFactory
quarkus.datasource.additional-jdbc-properties.cloudSqlInstance=project:zone:instance-name
--

NOTE: To set the environment variables (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD) when deploying to CloudRun there is an option  `ADD VARIABLE`

WARNING: Don't forget to add your service account key to the deployed image, and to accept requests on the expected port

[source,docker]
--
FROM gcr.io/distroless/java:11
COPY target/*.jar /app/application-runner.jar
COPY <your_service_account_key>.json /app
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["application-runner.jar","-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0", "-Dquarkus.http.port=$PORT"]
--

NOTE: `$PORT` value will be injected automatically by CloudRun and is to be used for HealthCheck


You should now be able to connect to your instance.
