# Maven Enforcer BOM Issue Analysis

## Problem
`nx validate build-parent` fails with the `maven-enforcer:enforce` task in the BOM project.

## Root Cause
The BOM project (`io.quarkus:quarkus-bom`) inherits from `quarkus-project` (root POM), not `quarkus-build-parent`. However, our Nx plugin is generating a `maven-enforcer:enforce` target for the BOM project even though:

1. The BOM doesn't have enforcer plugin configuration in its own POM
2. The BOM doesn't inherit from build-parent (which has the enforcer config)
3. When Maven runs the enforcer goal directly, it fails with "No rules are configured"

## Analysis
- **BOM POM structure**: Inherits from `quarkus-project` (root), not `quarkus-build-parent`
- **Build-parent POM**: Has proper enforcer plugin configuration with rules like:
  - `dependencyConvergence`
  - External rules from `quarkus-enforcer-rules` dependency
- **Our plugin**: Incorrectly generates enforcer targets for projects that don't have enforcer rules

## Issue Location
The issue is likely in our ExecutionPlanAnalysisService or target mapping logic where we're detecting the enforcer plugin execution but not properly checking if:
1. The project actually has enforcer rules configured
2. The project inherits the enforcer configuration from a parent

## Next Steps
Need to investigate the target generation logic to understand why we're creating enforcer targets for projects without proper enforcer configuration.
