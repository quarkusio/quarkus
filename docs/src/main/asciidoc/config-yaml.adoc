= YAML Configuration

include::./attributes.adoc[]

:toc:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML[YAML] is a very popular format. Kubernetes relies heavily on the YAML format to
write the various resource descriptors.

Quarkus offers the possibility to use YAML in addition to the standard Java Properties file.

== Enabling YAML Configuration

To enable YAML configuration add the `quarkus-config-yaml` extension:

[source, bash]
----
> ./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="io.quarkus:quarkus-config-yaml" # Maven
> ./gradlew addExtension --extensions="io.quarkus:quarkus-config-yaml" # Gradle
----

You can also just add the following dependency into your project:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-config-yaml</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Remove the `src/main/resources/application.properties` and create a `src/main/resources/application.yaml` file.

NOTE: If both are present, Quarkus prioritizes configuration properties from the YAML file first and then from the
Properties file. However, to avoid confusion, we recommend removing the Properties file.

TIP: Supports both the  `yml` or `yaml` file extensions.

=== Example

The following snippets provide examples of YAML configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
# YAML supports comments
quarkus:
  datasource:
    db-kind: postgresql
    jdbc:
      url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/some-database

# REST Client configuration property
org:
  acme:
    restclient:
      CountriesService/mp-rest/url: https://restcountries.eu/rest
----

[source,yaml]
----
# For configuration property names that use quotes, do not split the string inside the quotes
quarkus:
  log:
    category:
      "io.quarkus.category":
        level: INFO
----

[source, yaml]
----
quarkus:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/quarkus_test

  hibernate-orm:
    database:
      generation: drop-and-create

  oidc:
    enabled: true
    auth-server-url: http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus
    client-id: app


app:
  frontend:
    oidc-realm: quarkus
    oidc-app: app
    oidc-server: http://localhost:8180/auth

# With profiles
"%test":
   quarkus:
     oidc:
       enabled: false
     security:
        users:
            file:
              enabled: true
              realm-name: quarkus
              plain-text: true
----

== Profiles

As you can see in the previous snippet, you can use xref:config-reference.adoc#profiles[profiles] in YAML. The profile
key requires double quotes: `"%test"`. This is because YAML does not support keys starting with `%`.

Everything under the `"%test"` key is only enabled when the `test` profile is active. For example, in the previous
snippet it disables OIDC (`quarkus.oidc.enabled: false`), whereas without the `test` profile, it would be enabled.

As for the Java Properties format, you can define your own profile:

[source, yaml]
----
quarkus:
  http:
    port: 8081

"%staging":
    quarkus:
        http:
          port: 8082
----

If you enable the `staging` profile, the HTTP port will be 8082, whereas it would be 8081 otherwise.

The YAML configuration also support profile aware files. In this case, properties for a specific profile may reside in
an `application-{profile}.yaml` named file. The previous example may be expressed as:

.application.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
quarkus:
  http:
    port: 8081
----

.application-staging.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
quarkus:
  http:
    port: 8082
----

== Expressions

The YAML format also supports xref:config-reference.adoc#expressions[expressions], using the same format as Java
Properties:

[source, yaml]
----
mach: 3
x:
  factor: 2.23694

display:
  mach: ${mach}
  unit:
    name: "mph"
    factor: ${x.factor}
----

Note that you can reference nested properties using the `.` (dot) separator as in `{x.factor}`.

== External application.yaml file

The `application.yaml` file may also be placed in `config/application.yaml` to specialize the runtime configuration. The
file has to be present in the root of the working directoryrelative to the Quarkus application runner:

[source, text]
----
.
├── config
│    └── application.yaml
├── my-app-runner
----

The values from this file override any values from the regular `application.yaml` file if exists.

== Configuration key conflicts

The MicroProfile Config specification defines configuration keys as an arbitrary `.`-delimited string. However,
structured formats like YAML only support a subset of the possible configuration namespace. For example, consider the
two configuration properties `quarkus.http.cors` and `quarkus.http.cors.methods`. One property is the prefix of another,
so it may not be immediately evident how to specify both keys in your YAML configuration.

This is solved by using a `null` key (represented by `~`) for any YAML property which is a prefix of another one:

[source,yaml]
----
quarkus:
  http:
    cors:
      ~: true
      methods: GET,PUT,POST
----

YAML `null` keys are not included in the assembly of the configuration property name, allowing them to be used
in any level for disambiguating configuration keys.
