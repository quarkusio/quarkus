/**
 * {@link WebSocket} and {@link WebSocketClient} endpoint methods annotated with this annotation consume text messages. An
 * endpoint may declare at most one method annotated with this annotation.
 *
 * <h2>Execution model</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Methods annotated with {@link io.smallrye.common.annotation.RunOnVirtualThread} are considered blocking and should be
 * executed on a virtual thread.</li>
 * <li>Methods annotated with {@link io.smallrye.common.annotation.Blocking} are considered blocking and should be executed on a
 * worker thread.</li>
 * <li>Methods annotated with {@link io.smallrye.common.annotation.NonBlocking} are considered non-blocking and should be
 * executed on an event loop thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Execution model for methods which don't declare any of the annotation listed above is derived from the return type:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Methods returning {@code void} are considered blocking and should be executed on a worker thread.</li>
 * <li>Methods returning {@link io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni} or {@link io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi} are considered non-blocking and
 * should be executed on an event loop thread.</li>
 * <li>Methods returning any other type are considered blocking and should be executed on a worker thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Method parameters</h2>
 *
 * The method must accept exactly one message parameter. A text message is always represented as a {@link String}. Therefore,
 * the following conversion rules apply. The types listed below are handled specifically. For all other types a
 * {@link TextMessageCodec} is used to encode and decode input and output messages. By default, the first input codec that
 * supports the message type is used; codecs with higher priority go first. However, a specific codec can be selected with
 * {@link #codec()} and {@link #outputCodec()}.
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code java.lang.String} is used as is,</li>
 * <li>{@code io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject} is encoded with {@link io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject#encode()} and decoded with
 * {@link io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject#JsonObject(String))}.</li>
 * <li>{@code io.vertx.core.json.JsonArray} is encoded with {@link io.vertx.core.json.JsonArray#encode()} and decoded with
 * {@link io.vertx.core.json.JsonArray#JsonArray(String))}.</li>
 * <li>{@code java.lang.Buffer} is encoded with {@link io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer#toString()} and decoded with
 * {@link io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer#buffer(String)},</li>
 * <li>{@code byte[]} is first converted to {@link io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer} and then converted as defined above.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The method may also accept the following parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link WebSocketConnection}/{@link WebSocketClientConnection}; depending on the endpoint type</li>
 * <li>{@link HandshakeRequest}</li>
 * <li>{@link String} parameters annotated with {@link PathParam}</li>
 * </ul>
