= {project-name} - Using OpenTracing

This guide explains how your Quarkus application can utilize opentracing to provide distributed tracing for
interactive web applications.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* Docker

Remember, you need to configure Maven as indicated in the link:maven-config.html[Maven configuration page].

== Architecture

In this guide, we create a straightforward REST application to demonstrate distributed tracing.

== Solution

We recommend you to follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can skip right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone https://github.com/jbossas/quarkus-quickstarts.git`, or download an https://github.com/jbossas/quarkus-quickstarts/archive/master.zip[archive].

The solution is located in the `using-opentracing` https://github.com/jbossas/quarkus-quickstarts/tree/master/using-opentracing[directory].

== Creating the Maven project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=using-opentracing \
    -DclassName="org.acme.opentracing.TracedResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="smallrye-opentracing"
----

This command generates the Maven project with a REST endpoint and imports the `smallrye-opentracing` extension, which
includes the OpenTracing support and the default https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger] tracer.

=== Examine the JAX-RS resource

Open the `src/main/java/org/acme/opentracing/TracedResource.java` file and see the following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.opentracing;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class TracedResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

Notice that there is no tracing specific code included in the application. By default, requests sent to this
endpoint will be traced without any code changes being required. It is also possible to enhance the tracing information. For more information on this, please see the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-opentracing.asciidoc[MicroProfile OpenTracing specification].

== Run the application

The first step is to start the tracing system to collect and display the captured traces:

[source, text]
----
docker run -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 -p 5775:5775/udp -p 6831:6831/udp -p 6832:6832/udp -p 5778:5778 -p 16686:16686 -p 14268:14268 -p 9411:9411 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
----

Now we are ready to run our application. Use:

[source, text]
----
mvn compile quarkus:dev -Djvm.args="-DJAEGER_SERVICE_NAME=myservice -DJAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE=const -DJAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM=1 -DJAEGER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:14268/api/traces"
----

The supplied `jvm.args` are used to configure the default OpenTracing tracer (Jaeger). If the `JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME` property is not provided then a "no-op" tracer will be configured, resulting in no tracing data being reported to the backend. The other properties are explained in the https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/client-features/[Tracer configuration via environment variables] section of the Jaeger documentation.

NOTE: Currently the tracer can only be configured to report spans directly to the collector via HTTP, using the `JAEGER_ENDPOINT` property. Support for using the Jaeger agent, via UDP, will be available in a future version.

Once both the application and tracing system are started, you can make a request to the provided endpoint:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
hello
```
When the first request has been submitted, the Jaeger tracer within the app will be initialized:
```
2019-01-14 17:36:38,580 localhost using-opentracing-dev.jar[14190] INFO  [i.j.Configuration] (XNIO-1 task-1) Initialized tracer=JaegerTracer(version=Java-0.33.1, serviceName=myservice, reporter=RemoteReporter(sender=HttpSender(), closeEnqueueTimeout=1000), sampler=ConstSampler(decision=true, tags={sampler.type=const, sampler.param=true}), tags={hostname=localhost.localdomain, jaeger.version=Java-0.33.1, ip=127.0.0.1}, zipkinSharedRpcSpan=false, expandExceptionLogs=false, useTraceId128Bit=false)
```

Then visit the http://localhost:16686[Jaeger UI] to see the tracing information.


Hit `CTRL+C` to stop the application.
