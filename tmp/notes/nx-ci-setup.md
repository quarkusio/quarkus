# Nx CI Setup for Quarkus Incremental Builds

## Changes Made

Added Nx setup to the CI workflow without changing any existing Maven commands.

### Added Steps in build-jdk17 job:

1. **Node.js Setup** - Added Node.js 20 with npm caching
2. **Nx Installation** - Global installation of latest Nx CLI 
3. **nx-set-shas** - Configured to set base/head SHAs for incremental builds with main branch

### Key Details:

- All Maven commands (`./mvnw`) remain completely unchanged
- Nx setup happens after JDK setup but before Maven cache restoration
- Uses `nrwl/nx-set-shas@v4` action with main branch configuration
- Node.js 20 chosen for compatibility and stability

### Location:

File: `.github/workflows/ci-actions-incremental-nx.yml`
Job: `build-jdk17` (Initial JDK 17 Build)
Lines: ~209-220

This provides the foundation for future Nx integration while maintaining full Maven compatibility.
