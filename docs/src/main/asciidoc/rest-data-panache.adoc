= Quarkus - Generating JAX-RS resources with Panache

include::./attributes.adoc[]
:extension-status: experimental

A lot of web applications are monotonous CRUD applications with REST APIs that are tedious to write.
To streamline this task, REST Data with Panache extension can generate the basic CRUD endpoints for your entities and repositories.

While this extension is still experimental and provides a limited feature set, we hope to get an early feedback for it.
Currently this extension supports Hibernate ORM with Panache and can generate CRUD resources that work with `application/json` and `application/hal+json` content.

include::./status-include.adoc[]

== Setting up REST Data with Panache

To begin with:

* Add the required dependencies to your `pom.xml`
** Hibernate ORM REST Data with Panache extension (`quarkus-hibernate-orm-rest-data-panache`)
** A JDBC driver extension (`quarkus-jdbc-postgresql`, `quarkus-jdbc-h2`, `quarkus-jdbc-mariadb`, ...)
** One of the RESTEasy JSON serialization extensions (`quarkus-resteasy-jackson` or `quarkus-resteasy-jsonb`)

----

* Implement the Panache entities and/or repositories as explained in the link:hibernate-orm-panache[Hibernate ORM with Panache guide].
* Define the interfaces for generation as explained in the sections below.

== Generating resources

REST Data with Panache generates JAX-RS resources based on the interfaces available in your application.
For each entity and repository that you want to generate, provide an interface that extends either `PanacheEntityResource` or `PanacheRepositoryResource` interface.
_Do not implement these interfaces and don't provide custom methods because they will be ignored._ You can, however, override the methods from the extended interface in order to customize them (see the section at the end).

=== PanacheEntityResource

If your application has an entity (e.g. `Person`) that extends either `PanacheEntity` or `PanacheEntityBase` class, you could instruct REST Data with Panache to generate its JAX-RS resource with the following interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface PeopleResource extends PanacheEntityResource<Person, Long> {
}
----

=== PanacheRepositoryResource

If your application has a simple entity (e.g. `Person`) and a repository (e.g. `PersonRepository`) that implements either `PanacheRepository` or `PanacheRepositoryBase` interface, you could instruct REST Data with Panache to generate its JAX-RS resource with the following interface:

[source,java]
----
public interface PeopleResource extends PanacheRepositoryResource<PersonRepository, Person, Long> {
}
----

=== The generated resource

The generated resources will be functionally equivalent for both entities and repositories.
The only difference being the particular data access pattern in use.

If you have defined one of the `PeopleResource` interfaces mentioned above, REST Data with Panache will generate a JAX-RS resource similar to this:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/people") // Default path is a hyphenated lowercase resource name without a suffix of `resource` or `controller`.
public class PeopleResourceImpl implements PeopleResource { // The actual class name is going to be unique
    @GET
    @Produces("application/json")
    @Path("{id}")
    public Person get(@PathParam("id") Long id){
        // ...
    }

    @GET
    @Produces("application/json")
    public Response list(){
        // ...
    }

    @Transactional
    @POST
    @Consumes("application/json")
    @Produces("application/json")
    public Response add(Person entity) {
        // ..
    }

    @Transactional
    @PUT
    @Consumes("application/json")
    @Produces("application/json")
    @Path("{id}")
    public Response update(@PathParam("id") Long id, Person person) {
        // ..
    }

    @Transactional
    @DELETE
    @Path("{id}")
    public void delete(@PathParam("id") Long id) {
        // ..
    }
}
----

== Resource customisation

REST Data with Panache provides a `@ResourceProperties` and `@MethodProperties` annotations that can be used to customize certain features of the resource.
It can be used in your resource interface:

[source,java]
----
@ResourceProperties(hal = true, path = "my-people")
public interface PeopleResource extends PanacheEntityResource<Person, Long> {
    @MethodProperties(path = "all")
    Response list();

    @MethodProperties(exposed = false)
    void delete(Long id);
}
----

=== Available options

`@ResourceProperties`

* `hal` - in addition to the standard `application/json` responses, generates additional methods that can return `application/hal+json` responses if requested via an `Accept` header.
Default is `false`.
* `path` - resource base path. Default path is a hyphenated lowercase resource name without a suffix of `resource` or `controller`.
* `paged` - whether collection responses should be paged or not.
First, last, previous and next page URIs are included in the response headers if they exist.
Request page index and size are taken from the `page` and `size` query parameters that default to `0` and `20` respectively.
Default is `true`.

`@MethodProperties`

* `exposed` - does not expose a particular HTTP verb when set to `false`. Default is `true`.
* `path` - operation path (this is appended to the resource base path). Default is an empty string.

== Query parameters

REST Data with Panache supports the following query parameters with the generated resources.

* `page` - a page number which should be returned by a list operation.
It applies to the paged resources only and is a number starting with 0. Default is 0.
* `size` - a page size which should be returned by a list operation.
It applies to the paged resources only and is a number starting with 1. Default is 20.
* `sort` - a comma separated list of fields which should be used for sorting a result of a list operation.
Fields are sorted in the ascending order unless they're prefixed with a `-`.
E.g. `?sort=name,-age` will sort the result by the name ascending by the age descending.

== Response body examples

As mentioned above REST Data with Panache supports the `application/json` and `application/hal+json` response content types.
Here are a couple of examples of how a response body would look like for the `get` and `list` operations assuming there are five `Person` records in a database.

=== GET /people/1

`Accept: application/json`

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Johnson",
  "birth": "1988-01-10"
}
----

`Accept: application/hal+json`

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Johnson",
  "birth": "1988-01-10",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people/1"
    },
    "remove": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people/1"
    },
    "update": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people/1"
    },
    "add": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people"
    },
    "list": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people"
    }
  }
}
----

=== GET /people?page=0&size=2

`Accept: application/json`

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Johnson",
    "birth": "1988-01-10"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Peter Peterson",
    "birth": "1986-11-20"
  }
]

----

`Accept: application/hal+json`

[source,json]
----
{
  "_embedded": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Johnson",
      "birth": "1988-01-10",
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people/1"
        },
        "remove": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people/1"
        },
        "update": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people/1"
        },
        "add": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people"
        },
        "list": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Peter Peterson",
      "birth": "1986-11-20",
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people/2"
        },
        "remove": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people/2"
        },
        "update": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people/2"
        },
        "add": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people"
        },
        "list": {
          "href": "http://example.com/people"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "_links": {
    "add": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people"
    },
    "list": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people"
    },
    "first": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people?page=0&size=2"
    },
    "last": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people?page=2&size=2"
    },
    "next": {
      "href": "http://example.com/people?page=1&size=2"
    }
  }
}
----

Both responses would also contain these headers:

* Link: < http://example.com/people?page=0&size=2 >; rel="first"
* Link: < http://example.com/people?page=2&size=2 >; rel="last"
* Link: < http://example.com/people?page=1&size=2 >; rel="next"

A `previous` link header (and hal link) would not be included, because the previous page does not exist.
