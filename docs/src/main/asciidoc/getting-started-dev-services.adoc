= Your second Quarkus application
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:diataxis-type: tutorial
:categories: getting-started, data, core
:summary: Discover some of the features that make developing with Quarkus a joyful experience.
:topics: getting-started,dev-services

This tutorial shows you how to create an application which writes to and reads from a database.
You will use Dev Services, so you will not actually download, configure, or even start the database yourself.
You will also use Panache, a layer on top of Hibernate ORM, to make reading and writing data easier.

This guide helps you:

 *  Read and write objects to a database
 *  Develop and test against services with zero configuration

== Prerequisites

:prerequisites-time: 30 minutes
:prerequisites-docker:
:prerequisites-no-graalvm:
include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]

This tutorial builds on what you learned writing xref:getting-started.adoc[your first Quarkus application].
You will not need the code from that application, but make sure you understand the concepts.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions from <<Bootstrapping the project>> onwards to create the application step by step.

However, you can go right to the completed example.

Download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive] or clone the git repository:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}
----

The solution is located in the `getting-started-dev-services` {quickstarts-tree-url}/getting-started-dev-services[directory].

== Outline steps

- Bootstrap the application
- Update the application to read user input
- Create a Panache Entity
- Read and write the entity
- Configure an external database using a profile

== Setting up an interactive application

=== Bootstrapping the project

The easiest way to create a new Quarkus project is to open a terminal and run the following command:

:create-app-artifact-id: getting-started-dev-services
:create-app-extensions: rest
:create-app-code:
include::{includes}/devtools/create-app.adoc[]

For an explanation of what's in the generated application, see the xref:getting-started.adoc[First application guide].

=== Running the application

Launch the application in dev mode

include::{includes}/devtools/dev.adoc[]

Once the application is up, visit http://localhost:8080/hello. It should show a "Hello from Quarkus REST" message.

=== Accepting user input

Let's make the application a bit more interactive.
Open the project in your IDE and navigate to `src/main/java/org/acme/GreetingResource.java`
Add a query param in the `hello` method.
(The `org.jboss.resteasy.reactive.RestQuery` annotation is like the Jakarta REST `@QueryParam`
annotation, except you don't need to duplicate the parameter name.)

[source, java]
----
public String hello(@RestQuery String name) {
    return "Hello " + name;
}
----

Visit http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Bloom.

You should see a personalised message: `Hello Bloom`.

=== Fixing the tests

In your Quarkus terminal, type 'r' to run the tests. You should see
that your application changes broke the tests!

To fix the tests, open `src/test/java/org/acme/GreetingResourceTest.java`
and replace

[source, java]
----
             .body(is("Hello from Quarkus REST"));
----

with

[source, java]
----
             .body(containsString("Hello"));
----

This still validates the HTTP endpoint, but it's more flexible
about the expected output.
You should see in your terminal that the tests are now passing.

== Adding persistence

=== Creating a Panache Entity

1. To add the persistence libraries, run

:add-extension-extensions: hibernate-orm-panache,jdbc-postgresql
include::{includes}/devtools/extension-add.adoc[]

The application will record the names of people it greets. Define an Entity
by creating a `Greeting.java` class. Add the following content:

[source, java]
----
import io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.panache.PanacheEntity;
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;

@Entity
public class Greeting extends PanacheEntity {
    public String name;
}
----

The entity makes use of xref:hibernate-orm-panache.adoc[Panache], a layer on top of Hibernate ORM.
Extending `PanacheEntity` brings in a range of methods for reading, writing, and finding data.
Because all the data access methods are on the `Greeting` entity, rather than on a separate data access class,
this is an example of the active record pattern.

The `Greeting` table will have one column, a field called `name`.

=== Writing data

To use the new entity, update the `hello` method to start writing some data.

Change the method to the following:

[source, java]
----
@GET
@Transactional
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String hello(@QueryParam("name") String name) {
   Greeting greeting = new Greeting();
   greeting.name = name;
   greeting.persist();
   return "Hello " + name;
}
----

Don't forget the `@Transactional` annotation, which ensures writes are wrapped
in a transaction.

[NOTE]
.GETs should not change application state.
Generally, you shouldn't do state updates in a `GET` REST method, but here it makes
trying things out simpler. Let's assume what's being written is a logging "side effect",
rather than a meaningful state changes!

Try out the updated endpoint by visiting http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Bloom.
You should see a "Hello Bloom" message.

=== Reading data
Although the new persistence code seems to be working without errors, how
do you know anything is being written to the database?

Add a second REST method to `GreetingResource`.

[source, java]
----
@GET
@Path("names")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String names() {
    List<Greeting> greetings = Greeting.listAll();
    String names = greetings.stream().map(g-> g.name)
       .collect(Collectors.joining (", "));
    return "I've said hello to " + names;
}
----

To try it out, visit http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Bloom, and then http://localhost:8080/hello/names.

You should see the following message: "I've said hello to Bloom".

[IMPORTANT]
.a container runtime is required.
====
Don't forget that you need to have a container runtime available, or
you will start seeing failures in the Quarkus logs at this point.
====

== Dev services

Reading and writing to the database seems to be working well, but that's a bit unexpected.
Where did a PostgreSQL database come from? You didn't set anything up.

The database is being managed using xref:dev-services.adoc[Dev Services].
Dev Services take care of stopping and starting services needed by your application.
Because you
included the `jdbc-postgresql` dependency, the database is a containerised PostgreSQL database.
If you'd added `jdbc-mysql` instead, you would have gotten a containerised MySQL database.

If you like, use your container tool to see what containers are running.
For example, if you're using Docker, run `docker ps`, and for podman, run `podman ps`.
You should see something like the following:

----
ff88dcedd899  docker.io/library/postgres:14  postgres -c fsync...  20 minutes ago  Up 20 minutes  0.0.0.0:34789->5432/tcp  nostalgic_bassi
----

Stop Quarkus and run `docker ps` again.
You should see nothing running (it may take a few moments for containers to shut down).
Quarkus will automatically stop the container when your application stops.

=== Initialising services

If you play with your code some more, you may notice that sometimes, after making an application change, http://localhost:8080/hello/names doesn't list any names.
What's going on? By default, in dev mode, with a Dev Services database,
 Quarkus configures Hibernate ORM database generation to be `drop-and-create`.
 See the xref:hibernate-orm.adoc#quarkus-hibernate-orm_quarkus-hibernate-orm-database-generation[Hibernate configuration reference] for more details.
 If a code change triggers an application restart, the database tables
 will be dropped (deleted) and then re-created.

This is convenient, but what if you'd prefer the database to always have content?
That would make testing easier.
If you provide an `import.sql` file, Quarkus will use that to initialise
the database on each start.

1. Make a `src/main/resources/import.sql` file in your project
2. Add the following SQL statements:

[source, sql]
----
INSERT INTO Greeting(id, name)
VALUES (nextval('Greeting_SEQ'), 'Alice');
INSERT INTO Greeting(id, name)
VALUES (nextval('Greeting_SEQ'), 'Bob');
----

Now, hit `s` in your dev mode session, to force a full restart. Then visit http://localhost:8080/hello/names.

You'll see that Alice and Bob are always included in the list of names.

== Controlling Dev Services

=== Using an external database instead

What if you'd rather use an external database that you manage yourself?
Add the following to `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source, properties]
----
# configure your datasource
quarkus.datasource.db-kind = postgresql
quarkus.datasource.username = leopold
quarkus.datasource.password = bloom
quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
----

This tells Quarkus that you don't want it to start a Dev Service,
because you have your own database. You don't need to worry about starting
the database, because you're just seeing how to change the configuration.

Visit http://localhost:8080/hello/names. Instead of a list of names,
you'll get a red error screen. In the terminal where Quarkus is running.
you'll see the following stack error message:

----
2023-06-28 19:18:22,880 ERROR [io.qua.ver.htt.run.QuarkusErrorHandler] (executor-thread-1) HTTP Request to /hello?name=fred failed, error id: 4f9b5ce6-3b08-41c5-af36-24eee4d1dd2b-2: org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException: Unable to acquire JDBC Connection [Connection to localhost:5432 refused. Check that the hostname and port are correct and that the postmaster is accepting TCP/IP connections.] [n/a]
        at org.hibernate.exception.internal.SQLStateConversionDelegate.convert(SQLStateConversionDelegate.java:98)
        at org.hibernate.exception.internal.StandardSQLExceptionConverter.convert(StandardSQLExceptionConverter.java:56)
...
----

This makes sense; you've disabled the database Dev Service, but you haven't
started your own database.

=== Using profiles

Unless you want to, don't worry about setting up an external database
to resolve the connection error. Instead, you will go back to using the Dev Service.
It made life easy!

But what about production? You won't want to use Dev Services in production.
In fact, Quarkus only starts Dev Services in dev and test modes.

Wouldn't it be nice to configure an external database,
but have it *only* used in production, so you could still use Dev Services the rest of the time?

Add a `%prod.`
prefix to the database configuration. This means the configuration
only applies to the xref:config-reference.adoc#profiles[prod profile]

The configuration should look like this:

[source, properties]
----
# configure your datasource
%prod.quarkus.datasource.db-kind = postgresql
%prod.quarkus.datasource.username = leopold
%prod.quarkus.datasource.password = bloom
%prod.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
----

Now the external database will be used in prod mode,
and Dev Services will be used in dev and test modes.

Check http://localhost:8080/hello/names. It should be working again,
because the Dev Services have been re-enabled.
Notice that there was no need to restart Quarkus for any of these changes.


:sectnums!:
== Summary

You've taken a simple REST application and updated it to write and read
data from a database, using Hibernate ORM and Panache. The data was persisted to
a 'real' database, without you having to configure anything.
