= {project-name} - Extension Authors Guide

Shamrock extensions add a new developer focused behavior to the core offering, and consist of two distinct parts, buildtime augmentation and runtime container. The augmentation part is responsible for all metadata processing, such as reading annotations, XML descriptors etc. The output of this augmentation phase is recorded bytecode which is responsible for directly instantiating the relevant runtime services.

This means that metadata is only processed once at build time, which both saves on startup time, and also on memory
usage as the classes etc that are used for processing are not loaded (or even present) in the runtime JVM.

== Three Phases of Bootstrap and Shamrock Philosophy

There are three distinct bootstrap phases of a Shamrock app:

Augmentation::
    This is the first phase, and is done by the <<Build Step Processors>>. These processors have access to Jandex annotation
    information and can parse any descriptors and read annotations, but should not attempt to load any application classes. The output of these
    build steps is some recorded bytecode, using an extension of the ObjectWeb ASM project called Gizmo(ext/gizmo), that is used to actually bootstrap the application at runtime. Depending on the `org.jboss.shamrock.annotations.ExecutionTime` value of the `@org.jboss.shamrock.annotations.Record` annotation associated with the build step, 
    the step may be run in a different JVM based on the following two modes.

Static Init::
    If bytecode is recorded with `@Record(STATIC_INIT)` then it will be executed from a static init method on the main
    class. For a native image build, this code is executed in a normal JVM as part of the image build
    process, and any retained objects that are produced in this stage will be directly serialized into the native image via an image mapped file.
    This means that if a framework can boot in this phase then it will have its booted state directly written to the
    image, and so the boot code does not need to be executed when the image is started.
+
There are some restrictions on what can be done in this stage as the Substrate VM disallows some objects in the native image. For example you should not attempt to listen on a port or start threads in this phase.
+
In non-native pure JVM mode, there is no real difference between Static and Runtime Init, except that Static Init is always executed first. This mode benefits from the same build phase augmentation as native mode as the descriptor parsing and annotation scanning are done
at build time and any associated class/framework dependencies can be removed from the build output jar. In servers like
WildFly, deployment related classes such as XML parsers hang around for the life of the application, using up valuable
memory. Shamrock aims to eliminate this, so that the only classes loaded at runtime are actually used at runtime.
+
As an example, the only reason that a Shamrock application should load an XML parser is if the user is using XML in their
application. Any XML parsing of configuration should be done in the Augmentation phase.

Runtime Init::
    If bytecode is recorded with `@Record(RUNTIME_INIT)` then it is executed from the application's main method. This code
    will be run on native image boot. In general as little code as possible should be executed in this phase, and should
    be restricted to code that needs to open ports etc.

Pushing as much as possible into the `@Record(STATIC_INIT)` phase allows for two different optimizations:

1. In both native image and pure JVM mode this allows the app to start as fast as possible since processing was done during build time. This also minimizes the classes/native code needed in the application to pure runtime related behaviors.

2. Another benefit with native image mode is that Substrate can more easily eliminate features that are not used. If features are directly initialized via bytecode, Substrate can detect that a method is never called and eliminate
that method. If config is read at runtime, Substrate cannot reason about the contents of the config and so needs to keep all features in case they are required.


== Maven setup

Your extension project should be setup as a multi-module project with two submodules:

1. A deployment time submodule that handles the build time processing and bytecode recording.

2. A runtime submodule that contains the runtime behavior that will provide the exentsion behavior in the native image or runtime JVM.

Your runtime artifact should depend on shamrock-core-runtime, and possibly the runtime artifacts of other Shamrock
modules if you want to use functionality provided by them. You will also need to include the `maven-dependency-plugin`
to write out the needed runtime dependencies, if you are using the Shamrock parent pom it will automatically
inherit the correct configuration.

Under no circumstances can the runtime module depend on a deployment artifact. This would result
in pulling all the deployment time code into runtime scope, which defeats the purpose of having the split.

and possibly the deployment artifacts of other Shamrock modules if you want to use functionality provided by them.

NOTE: For historical reasons the `augment` step is still called `deployment`, this will likely remain until we do our big rename.

== Build Step Processors

Work is done at deployment time by producing and consuming instances of `org.jboss.builder.item.BuildItem`. This is done
by creating a class that has method(s) annotated with `org.jboss.shamrock.annotations.BuildStep`. These classes can
consume items by injection, and produce items by either returning them from the method or by injecting an
instance of `org.jboss.shamrock.annotations.BuildProducer` for the produced type. These processors can also record
bytecode invocations, which is mapped to a `BuildItem` transparently.

There are two distinct types of `BuildItem`, `SimpleBuildItem` and `MultiBuildItem`. `SimpleBuildItem` will only ever
have a single instance created, while `MultiBuildItem` can have many instances.

Injection can be done either via field injection, or via method parameter injection. Injection is used to set up
dependencies between build steps. For example if you inject a `List<ServletBuildItem>` your build step will not be called
until all possible producers of `ServletBuildItem` have been called. Injected objects are only valid during a `@BuildStep`
method invocation, once the method is complete they are no longer valid.

The following items are valid for injection:

- `SimpleBuildItem` instances (at some point we may support `Optional<SimpleBuildItem>`, but it is not implemented yet)
- `List<? extension MultiBuildItem>` instances
- `BuildProducer<? extends BuildItem>` instances

If a method returns a `BuildItem`, or injects a `BuildProducer` it is considered to be a producer of that item type,
while if it injects the item or list of items it is a consumer.

Note that a `@BuildStep` method will only be called if it produces something that another consumer or the final output
requires. If there is no consumer for a particular item then it will not be produced. What is required will depend on
the final target that is being produced, for example when running in developer mode the final output will not ask
for Substrate-specific build items such as `ReflectiveClassBuildItem` so methods that only produce Substrate specific
items will not be invoked.

Note that private methods and fields are not allowed, as injection is resolved at compile time via an annotation processor,
and the resulting code does not have permission to inject private fields or invoke private methods.

`BuildItem` instances should be immutable, as the producer/consumer model does not allow for mutation to be correctly
ordered. This is not enforced but failure to adhere to this can result in race conditions.

=== Capabilities

The `@BuildStep` annotation has a `providesCapabilities` property that can be used to provide capability information
to other extensions about what is present in the current application. Capabilities are simply strings that are used to
describe an extension. Capabilities should generally be named after an extensions root package, for example the transactions
extension will provide `org.jboss.shamrock.transactions`.

To check if a capability is present you can inject the `org.jboss.shamrock.deployment.Capabilities` object and call
`isCapabilityPresent`.

Capabilities should be used when checking for the presence of an extension rather than class path based checks.

=== Application Archives

The `@BuildStep` annotation can also register marker files that determine which archives on the class path are considered
to be 'Application Archives', and will therefore get indexed. This is done via the `applicationArchiveMarkers`. For
example the ArC extension registers `META-INF/beans.xml`, which means that all archives on the class path with a `beans.xml`
file will be indexed.

== Configuration

Simple configuration is done via the  https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] `@org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty` annotations.

[source%nowrap,java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;

public class MetricsProcessor {

    /**
     * The path to the metrics Servlet
     */
    // <1>
    @ConfigProperty(name = "shamrock.metrics.path", defaultValue = "/metrics")
    String path;
----
<1> Note that there is no @Inject qualifier here. This is a feature of the CDI implementation used by the Shamrock core to process @ConfigProperty only available to the deployment time extension.

The value of these properties is configured in a `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file that conforms to the MicroProfile config format.

An extension of MicroProfile config to allow configuration objects to be injected is available using the `@org.jboss.shamrock.runtime.ConfigGroup` annotation. You place this annotation on the configuration object which in turn uses @ConfigProperty for it's configurable values as follows:

[source%nowrap,java]
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;
import org.jboss.shamrock.runtime.ConfigGroup;

@ConfigGroup <1>
public class FileConfig {

    /**
     * If file logging should be enabled
     */
    @ConfigProperty(name = "enable", defaultValue = "true")
    boolean enable;

    /**
     * The log format
     */
    @ConfigProperty(name = "format", defaultValue = "%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS} %h %N[%i] %-5p [%c{1.}] (%t) %s%e%n")
    String format;

    /**
     * The file log level
     */
    @ConfigProperty(name = "level", defaultValue = "ALL")
    String level;

    /**
     * The file logging log level
     */
    @ConfigProperty(name = "path", defaultValue = "shamrock.log")
    String path;

}

public class LoggingProcessor {
...
    /**
     * File logging config
     */
    <2>
    @ConfigProperty(name = "shamrock.log.file")
    FileConfig file;
}
----
<1> The FileConfig object is annotated with @ConfigGroup to indcate that this is an aggregate
configuration object containing a collection of configurable properties.
<2> Here the LoggingProcessor injects a FileConfig instance using the MicroProfile Config annotation with the property name "shamrock.log.file". 

A corresponding `META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file for the FileConfig values could be:
[source%nowrap,properties]
----
shamrock.log.file.enable=true
shamrock.log.file.level=DEBUG
shamrock.log.file.path=/tmp/debug.log
----

The full property name in the configuraiton file is the property name used to inject the @ConfigGroup annotated object + the local property names in the configuration object.

[WARNING]
====
The support for @ConfigProperty in deployment time extensions may change in the future.

== Bytecode Recording

One of the main outputs of the build process is recorded bytecode. This bytecode actually sets up the runtime environment. For example, in order to start Undertow, the resulting application will have some bytecode that directly registers all
Servlet instances and then starts Undertow.

As writing bytecode directly is incredibly complex, this is instead done via bytecode recorders. At deployment time, invocations
are made on proxy instances of template objects that contain the actual runtime logic, and these invocations are recorded,
including the value of method parameters. Bytecode is then created to do these same invocations on the actual template
object at runtime.

In more detail, a processor class from the extensions deployment module gathers the configuration
information within a `@BuildStep` method that is also annotated with a `@Record(STATIC_INIT)` or  `@Record(RUNTIME_INIT)` annotation along with injection of a `@Template` annotated class
from the runtime module. A class annotated with `@Template` is known as a template because it
provides a template of methods to configure a runtime service. The value of template that is
injected into the deployment class is a proxy of the template, and any method invocations that are made will be recorded, and output as bytecode that will be run at application startup.

Methods on a template can return a value, which must be proxiable (if you want to return a non-proxiable item wrap it
in `org.jboss.shamrock.runtime.RuntimeValue`). These proxies may not be invoked directly, however they can be passed
into other template methods. This can be any template method, including from other `@Record` methods, so a common pattern
is to produce `BuildItem` instances that wrap the results of these template invocations.

For instance, in order to make arbitrary changes to a Servlet deployment Undertow has a `ServletExtensionBuildItem`,
which is a `MultiBuildItem` that wraps a `ServletExtension` instance. I can return a `ServletExtension` from a template
in another module, and Undertow will consume it and pass it into the template method that starts Undertow.

At runtime the bytecode will be invoked in the order it is generated. This means that build step dependencies implicitly
control the order that generated bytecode is run. In the example above we know that the bytecode that produces a
`ServletExtensionBuildItem` will be run before the bytecode that consumes it.


=== RecorderContext

`org.jboss.shamrock.deployment.recording.RecorderContext` provides some convenience methods to enhance bytecode recording,
this includes the ability to register creation functions for classes without no-arg constructors, to register an object
substitution (basically a transformer from a non-serializable object to a serializable one and vice versa), and to create
a class proxy. This interface can be directly injected as a method parameter into any `@Record` method.

Calling `classProxy` with a given class name will create a `Class` that can be passed into template
methods, and at runtime will be substituted with the class whose name was passed in to `classProxy`. This is basically a
convenience to avoid the need to explicitly load classes in the templates.


TODO: config integration


== Testing Extensions

Testing of extensions should be done with the `org.jboss.shamrock.test.ShamrockUnitTest` runner. This runner allows
for Arquillian-style tests that test specific functionalities. It is not intended for testing user applications, as this
should be done via `org.jboss.shamrock.test.ShamrockTest`. The main difference between these test runners is that
`ShamrockTest` simply boots the application once at the start of the run, while `ShamrockUnitTest` deploys a custom
Shamrock application for each test class.

These tests should be placed in the deployment module, if additional Shamrock modules are required for testing
their deployment modules should also be added as test scoped dependencies.

An example test class may look like:

[source,java]
----
import javax.enterprise.inject.Instance;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.*;
import org.jboss.shamrock.test.*;
import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.ShrinkWrap;

import org.jboss.shrinkwrap.api.spec.JavaArchive;
import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(ShamrockUnitTest.class)                                     <1>
public class FailingUnitTest {

    @Deployment                                                      <2>
    public static JavaArchive deploy() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class)
                .addClasses(FailingHealthCheck.class)
                .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
    }

    @Inject                                                          <3>
    @Health
    Instance<HealthCheck> checks;

    @Test
    public void testHealthServlet() {
        URLResponse rep = URLTester.relative("health").invokeURL();  <4>
        Assert.assertEquals(503, rep.statusCode());
    }

    @Test
    public void testHealthBeans() {
        List<HealthCheck> check = new ArrayList<>();                 <5>
        for (HealthCheck i : checks) {
            check.add(i);
        }
        Assert.assertEquals(1, check.size());
        Assert.assertEquals(HealthCheckResponse.State.DOWN, check.get(0).call().getState());
    }
}
