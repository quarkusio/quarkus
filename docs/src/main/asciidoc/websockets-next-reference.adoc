The `quarkus-websockets-next` extension provides a modern declarative API to define WebSocket server and client endpoints.

== The WebSocket protocol

The _WebSocket_ protocol, documented in the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455[RFC6455], establishes a standardized method for creating a bidirectional communication channel between a client and a server through a single TCP connection.
Unlike HTTP, WebSocket operates as a distinct TCP protocol but is designed to function seamlessly alongside HTTP.
For example, it reuses the same ports and is compatible with the same security mechanisms.

The interaction using WebSocket initiates with an HTTP request employing the 'Upgrade' header to transition to the WebSocket protocol.
Instead of a `200 OK` response, the server replies with a `101 Switching Protocols` response to upgrade the HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection.
Following this successful handshake, the TCP socket utilized in the initial HTTP upgrade request remains open, allowing both client and server to exchange messages in both direction continually.

== HTTP and WebSocket architecture styles

Despite WebSocket's compatibility with HTTP and its initiation through an HTTP request, it's crucial to recognize that the two protocols lead to distinctly different architectures and programming models.

With HTTP/REST, applications are structured around resources/endpoints that handle various HTTP methods and paths.
Client interaction occurs through emitting HTTP requests with appropriate methods and paths, following a request-response pattern.
The server routes incoming requests to corresponding handlers based on path, method, and headers and then replies with a well-defined response.

Conversely, WebSocket typically involves a single endpoint for the initial HTTP connection, after which all messages utilize the same TCP connection.
It introduces an entirely different interaction model: asynchronous and message-driven.

WebSocket is a low-level transport protocol, in contrast to HTTP.
Message formats, routing, or processing require prior agreement between the client and server regarding message semantics.

For WebSocket clients and servers, the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in the HTTP handshake request allows negotiation of a higher-level messaging protocol. In its absence, the server and client must establish their own conventions.

== Quarkus WebSockets vs. Quarkus WebSockets Next

This guide utilizes the `quarkus-websockets-next` extension, an implementation of the WebSocket API boasting enhanced efficiency and usability compared to the legacy `quarkus-websockets` extension.
The original `quarkus-websockets` extension remains accessible, will receive ongoing support, but it's unlikely to receive to feature development.

Unlike `quarkus-websockets`, the `quarkus-websockets-next` extension does **not** implement the Jakarta WebSocket specification.
Instead, it introduces a modern API, prioritizing simplicity of use.
Additionally, it's tailored to integrate with Quarkus' reactive architecture and networking layer seamlessly.

The annotations utilized by the Quarkus WebSockets next extension differ from those in JSR 356 despite, sometimes, sharing the same name.
The JSR annotations carry a semantic that the Quarkus WebSockets Next extension does not follow.

== Use the WebSockets Next extension

To use the `websockets-next` extension, you need to add the `io.quarkus.quarkus-websockets-next` extension to your project.
In your `pom.xml` file, add:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-websockets-next</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-websockets-next")
----


== Configure the WebSocket server

The WebSocket handling reuses the _main_ HTTP server.

Thus, the configuration of the WebSocket server is done in the `quarkus.http.` configuration section.

WebSocket paths configured within the application are concatenated with the root path defined by `quarkus.http.root` (which defaults to /).
This concatenation ensures that WebSocket endpoints are appropriately positioned within the application's URL structure.

Refer to the xref:http-reference.adoc[HTTP guide] for more details.

== Declare WebSocket endpoints

To declare web socket endpoints, you need to create a class annotated with `@io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocket` and define the path of the WebSocket endpoint:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.websockets;

import io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocket;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

@WebSocket(path = "/chat/{username}")
public class ChatWebSocket {

}
----

Thus, client can connect to this web socket endpoint using `ws://localhost:8080/chat/your-name`.
If TLS is used, the URL is `wss://localhost:8443/chat/your-name`.

=== Path parameters

The path of the WebSocket endpoint can contain path parameters.
The syntax is the same as for JAX-RS resources: `{parameterName}`.

Access to the path parameter values is done through the `io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocketConnection` _session_ object:

[source,java]
----
@Inject io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocketConnection session;
// ...
String value = session.pathParam("parameterName");
----

Path parameter values are always strings.
If the path parameter is not present in the path, the `pathParam` method returns `null`.

NOTE: Query parameters are not supported. However, you can access the query using `session.handshakeRequest().query()`

=== Sub-websockets endpoints

A class annotated with `@WebSocket` can encapsulate static nested classes, which are also annotated with `@WebSocket` and represent _sub-web_ sockets.
The resulting path of these sub-web sockets concatenates the path from the enclosing class and the nested class.
The resulting path is normalized, following the HTTP URL rules.

Sub-web sockets inherit access to the path parameters declared in the `@WebSocket` annotation of both the enclosing and nested classes.
The `consumePrimary` method within the enclosing class can access the `version` parameter in the following example.
Meanwhile, the `consumeNested` method within the nested class can access both `version` and `id` parameters:

[source, java]
----
@WebSocket(path = "/ws/v{version}")
public class MyPrimaryWebSocket {

    @OnTextMessage
    void consumePrimary(String s)    { ... }

    @WebSocket(path = "/products/{id}")
    public static class MyNestedWebSocket {

      @OnTextMessage
      void consumeNested(String s)    { ... }

    }

}
----

=== CDI Scopes for WebSocket Endpoints
Classes annotated with `@WebSocket` are managed as CDI beans, allowing for flexible scope management within the application.
By default, WebSocket endpoints are considered in the singleton pseudo-scope.
However, developers can specify alternative scopes to suit their specific requirements:

[source,java]
----
@WebSocket(path = "/ws")
public class MyWebSocket {
    // Singleton scoped bean
}

@WebSocket(path = "/ws")
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyRequestScopedWebSocket {
  // Application scoped.
}
----

Furthermore, each WebSocket connection is associated with its own _session_ scope.
When the `@OnOpen` method is invoked, a session scope corresponding to the WebSocket connection is established.
Subsequent calls to `@On[Text|Binary]Message` or `@OnClose` methods utilize this same session scope.
The session scope remains active until the `@OnClose` method completes execution, at which point it is terminated.

The `WebSocketConnection` object, which represents the connection itself, is also a session-scoped bean, allowing developers to access and manage WebSocket-specific data within the context of the session.

In cases where a WebSocket endpoint does not declare an `@OnOpen` method, the session scope is still created.
It remains active until the connection terminates, regardless of the presence of an `@OnClose` method.

Methods annotated with `@OnTextMessage,` `@OnBinaryMessage,` `@OnOpen`, and `@OnClose` also have the request scoped activated for the duration of the method execution (until it produced its result).


=== WebSocket endpoint methods

A WebSocket endpoint comprises the following components:

* Path: This is the URL path where the WebSocket connection is established (e.g., ws://localhost:8080/).
* At most one `@OnTextMessage` method: Handles the connected client's text messages.
* At most one `@OnBinaryMessage` method: Handles the binary messages the connected client sends.
* At most one `@OnOpen` method: Invoked when a client connects to the WebSocket.
* At most one `@OnClose` method: Executed upon the client disconnecting from the WebSocket.
* Any number of `@OnError` methods: Invoked when an error occurs; that is when an endpoint callback throws a runtime error, or when a conversion errors occurs, or when a returned `io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni`/`io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi` receives a failure. 

Only some endpoints need to include all methods.
However, it must contain at least `@On[Text|Binary]Message` or `@OnOpen`.

An error is thrown at build time if any endpoint violates these rules.
The static nested classes representing sub-websockets adhere to the same guidelines.

IMPORTANT: Any methods annotated with `@OnTextMessage`, `@OnBinaryMessage`, `@OnOpen`, and `@OnClose` outside a WebSocket endpoint are considered erroneous and will result in the build failing with an appropriate error message.

== Processing messages

Method receiving messages from the client are annotated with `@OnTextMessage` or `@OnBinaryMessage`.

`OnTextMessage` are invoked for every _text_ message received from the client.
`OnBinaryMessage` are invoked for every _binary_ message the client receives.

=== Invocation Rules

When invoking these annotated methods, the _session_ scope linked to the WebSocket connection remains active.
In addition, the request scope is active until the completion of the method (or until it produces its result for async and reactive methods).

Quarkus WebSocket Next supports _blocking_ and _non-blocking_ logic, akin to Quarkus REST, determined by the method signature and additional annotations such as `@Blocking` and `@NonBlocking`.

Here are the rules governing execution:

* Non-blocking methods must execute on the connection's event loop.
* Methods annotated with `@RunOnVirtualThread` are considered blocking and should execute on a virtual thread.
* Blocking methods must execute on a worker thread if not annotated with `@RunOnVirtualThread`.
* When `@RunOnVirtualThread` is employed, each invocation spawns a new virtual thread.
* Methods returning `CompletionStage`, `Uni` and `Multi` are considered non-blocking.
* Methods returning `void` or plain objects are considered blocking.

=== Method Parameters

The method must accept exactly one message parameter:

* The message object (of any type).
* A `Multi<X>` with X as the message type.

However, it may also accept the following parameters:

 * `WebSocketConnection`
 * `HandshakeRequest`
 * `String` parameters annotated with `@PathParam`
 
The message object represents the data sent and can be accessed as either raw content (`String`, `JsonObject`, `JsonArray`, `Buffer` or `byte[]`) or deserialized high-level objects, which is the recommended approach.

When receiving a `Multi`, the method is invoked once per connection, and the provided `Multi` receives the items transmitted by this connection.
The method must subscribe to the `Multi` to receive these items (or return a Multi).

=== Allowed Returned Types

Methods annotated with `@OnTextMessage` or `@OnBinaryMessage` can return various types to handle WebSocket communication efficiently:

* `void`: Indicates a blocking method where no explicit response is sent back to the client.
* `Uni<Void>`: Denotes a non-blocking method where the completion of the returned Uni signifies the end of processing. No explicit response is sent back to the client.
* An object of type `X` represents a blocking method in which the returned object is serialized and sent back to the client as a response.
* `Uni<X>`: Specifies a non-blocking method where the item emitted by the non-null `Uni` is sent to the client as a response.
* `Multi<X>`: Indicates a non-blocking method where the items emitted by the non-null `Multi` are sequentially sent to the client until completion or cancellation.

Here are some examples of these methods:

[source, java]
----
@OnTextMessage
void consume(Message m) {
// Process the incoming message. The method is called on an executor thread for each incoming message.
}

@OnTextMessage
Uni<Void> consumeAsync(Message m) {
// Process the incoming message. The method is called on an event loop thread for each incoming message.
// The method completes when the returned Uni emits its item.
}

@OnTextMessage
ResponseMessage process(Message m) {
// Process the incoming message and send a response to the client.
// The method is called for each incoming message.
// Note that if the method returns `null`, no response will be sent to the client.
}

@OnTextMessage
Uni<ResponseMessage> processAsync(Message m) {
// Process the incoming message and send a response to the client.
// The method is called for each incoming message.
// Note that if the method returns `null`, no response will be sent to the client. The method completes when the returned Uni emits its item.
}

@OnTextMessage
Multi<ResponseMessage> stream(Message m) {
// Process the incoming message and send multiple responses to the client.
// The method is called for each incoming message.
// The method completes when the returned Multi emits its completion signal.
// The method cannot return `null` (but an empty multi if no response must be sent)
}
----

When returning a Multi, Quarkus subscribes to the returned Multi automatically and writes the emitted items until completion, failure, or cancellation. Failure or cancellation terminates the connection.

=== Streams

In addition to individual messages, WebSocket endpoints can handle streams of messages.
In this case, the method receives a `Multi<X>` as a parameter.
Each instance of `X` is deserialized using the same rules listed above.

The method receiving the `Multi` can either return another `Multi` or `void`.
If the method returns a `Multi`, it does not have to subscribe to the incoming `multi`:

[source, java]
----
@OnTextMessage
public Multi<ChatMessage> stream(Multi<ChatMessage> incoming) {
    return incoming.log();
}
----

This approach allows bi-directional streaming.

When the method returns `void`, it must subscribe to the incoming `Multi`:

[source, java]
----
@OnTextMessage
public void stream(Multi<ChatMessage> incoming) {
    incoming.subscribe().with(item -> log(item));
}
----

=== Skipping reply
When a method is intended to produce a message written to the client, it can emit `null`.
Emitting `null` signifies no response to be sent to the client, allowing for skipping a response when needed.

=== JsonObject and JsonArray
Vert.x `JsonObject` and `JsonArray` instances bypass the serialization and deserialization mechanisms.
Messages are sent as text messages.

=== Broadcasting
By default, responses produced by `@On[Text|Binary]Message` methods are sent back to the connected client.
However, using the `broadcast` parameter, responses can be broadcasted to all connected clients.

[source, java]
----
@OnTextMessage(broadcast=true)
String emitToAll(String message) {
    // Send the response to all connected clients.
}
----

The same principle applies to methods returning instances of `Multi` or `Uni`.

NOTE: If you need to select the connected clients that should receive the message, you can use `WebSocketConnection.broadcast().filter().sendText()`.

== OnOpen and OnClose methods

The WebSocket endpoint can also be notified when a client connects or disconnects.

This is done by annotating a method with `@OnOpen` or `@OnClose`:

[source,java]
----
@OnOpen(broadcast = true)
public ChatMessage onOpen() {
    return new ChatMessage(MessageType.USER_JOINED, connection.pathParam("username"), null);
}

@Inject WebSocketConnection connection;

@OnClose
public void onClose() {
    ChatMessage departure = new ChatMessage(MessageType.USER_LEFT, connection.pathParam("username"), null);
    connection.broadcast().sendTextAndAwait(departure);
}
----

`@OnOpen` is triggered upon client connection, while `@OnClose` is invoked upon disconnection.

These methods have access to the _session-scoped_ `WebSocketConnection` bean.

=== Parameters

Methods annotated with `@OnOpen` and `@OnClose` may accept the following parameters:

 * `WebSocketConnection`
 * `HandshakeRequest`
 * `String` parameters annotated with `@PathParam`
 
An endpoint method annotated with `@OnClose` may also accept the `io.quarkus.websockets.next.CloseReason` parameter that may indicate a reason for closing a connection.

=== Allowed Returned Types

`@OnOpen` and `@OnClose` methods support different returned types.

For `@OnOpen` methods, the same rules as `@On[Text|Binary]Message` apply.
Thus, a method annotated with `@OnOpen` can send messages to the client immediately after connecting.
The supported return types for `@OnOpen` methods are:

* `void`: Indicates a blocking method where no explicit message is sent back to the connected client.
* `Uni<Void>`: Denotes a non-blocking method where the completion of the returned `Uni` signifies the end of processing. No message is sent back to the client.
* An object of type `X`: Represents a blocking method where the returned object is serialized and sent back to the client.
* `Uni<X>`: Specifies a non-blocking method where the item emitted by the non-null `Uni` is sent to the client.
* `Multi<X>`: Indicates a non-blocking method where the items emitted by the non-null `Multi` are sequentially sent to the client until completion or cancellation.

Items sent to the client are serialized except for the `String`, `JsonObject`, `JsonArray`, `Buffer`, and `byte[]` types.
In the case of `Multi`, Quarkus subscribes to the returned `Multi` and writes the items to the `WebSocket` as they are emitted.
`String`, `JsonObject` and `JsonArray` are sent as text messages.
`Buffers` and byte arrays are sent as binary messages.

For `@OnClose` methods, the allowed return types are:

* `void`: The method is considered blocking.
* `Uni<Void>`: The method is considered non-blocking.

`@OnClose` methods cannot send items to the connection client by returning objects.
They can only send messages to the other client by using the `WebSocketConnection` object.

=== Server-side Streaming

Methods annotated with `@OnOpen` can utilize server-side streaming by returning a `Multi<X>`:

[source, java]
----
@WebSocket(path = "/foo")
@OnOpen
public Multi<Integer> streaming() {
    return Multi.createFrom().ticks().every(Duration.ofSecond(1))
        .onOverflow().ignore();
}
----

=== Broadcasting with @OnOpen

Similar to `@On[Text|Binary]Message`, items sent to the client from a method annotated with `@OnOpen` can be broadcasted to all clients instead of just the connecting client:

[source, java]
----
@OnOpen(broadcast=true)
String onOpen() {
    return "We have a new member!";
}
----

== Error Handling

The WebSocket endpoint can also be notified when an error occurs.
A WebSocket endpoint method annotated with `@io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnError` is invoked when an endpoint callback throws a runtime error, or when a conversion errors occurs, 
or when a returned `io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni`/`io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi` receives a failure.

The method must accept exactly one "error" parameter, i.e. a parameter that is assignable from `java.lang.Throwable`.
The method may also accept the following parameters:

* `WebSocketConnection`
* `HandshakeRequest`
* `String` parameters annotated with `@PathParam`

An endpoint may declare multiple methods annotated with `@io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnError`.
However, each method must declare a different error parameter.
The method that declares a most-specific supertype of the actual exception is selected.

NOTE: The `@io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnError` annotation can be also used to declare a global error handler, i.e. a method that is not declared on a WebSocket endpoint. Such a method may not accept `@PathParam` paremeters. Error handlers declared on an endpoint take precedence over the global error handlers.

When an error occurs but no error handler can handle the failure, Quarkus uses the strategy specified by `quarkus.websockets-next.server.unhandled-failure-strategy` and `quarkus.websockets-next.client.unhandled-failure-strategy`, respectively.
By default, the connection is closed.
Alternatively, an error message can be logged or no operation performed.

== Access to the WebSocketConnection

The `io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocketConnection` object represents the WebSocket connection.
It's _session-scoped_  and is valid for the whole duration of the connection.

Methods annotated with `@OnOpen`, `@OnTextMessage`, `@OnBinaryMessage`, and `@OnClose` can access the `WebSocketConnection` object:

[source,java]
----
@Inject WebSocketConnection connection;
----

Note that outside of these methos, the `WebSocketConnection` object is not available.

The connection can be used to send messages to the client, access the path parameters, and broadcast messages to all connected clients.

[source, java]
----
// Send a message:
connection.sendTextAndAwait("Hello!");

// Broadcast messages:
connection.broadcast().sendTextAndAwait(departure);

// Access path parameters:
String param = connection.pathParam("foo");
----

The `WebSocketConnection` provides both a blocking and a non-blocking method to send messages:

- `sendTextAndAwait(String message)`: Sends a text message to the client and waits for the message to be sent. It's blocking and should only be called from an executor thread.
- `sendText(String message)`: Sends a text message to the client. It returns a `Uni`. It's non-blocking, but you must subscribe to it.

=== List open connections

It is also possible to list all open connections.
Quarkus provides a CDI bean of type `io.quarkus.websockets.next.OpenConnections` that declares convenient methods to access the connections.

[source, java]
----
import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import io.quarkus.websockets.next.OpenConnections;

class MyBean {

  @Inject
  OpenConnections connections;

  void logAllOpenConnections() {
     Log.infof("Open connections: %s", connections.listAll()); <1>
  }
}
----
<1> `OpenConnections#listAll()` returns an immutable snapshot of all open connections at the given time.

There are also other convenient methods.
For example, `OpenConnections#findByEndpointId(String)` makes it easy to find connections for a specific endpoint.

== Serialization and Deserialization

The WebSocket Next extension supports automatic serialization and deserialization of messages.


Objects of type `String`, `JsonObject`, `JsonArray`, `Buffer`, and `byte[]` are sent as-is and by-pass the serialization and deserialization.
When no codec is provided, the serialization and deserialization uses JSON (Jackson) automatically.

When you need to customize the serialization and deserialization, you can provide a custom codec.

=== Custom codec

To implement a custom codec, you must provides a CDI bean implementing:

- `io.quarkus.websockets.next.BinaryMessageCodec`  for binary messages
- `io.quarkus.websockets.next.TextMessageCodec`  for text messages

The following example shows how to implement a custom codec for a `Item` class:

[source, java]
----
@Singleton
    public static class ItemBinaryMessageCodec implements BinaryMessageCodec<Item> {

        @Override
        public boolean supports(Type type) {
            // Allows selecting the right codec for the right type
            return type.equals(Item.class);
        }

        @Override
        public Buffer encode(Item value) {
            // Serialization
            return Buffer.buffer(value.toString());
        }

        @Override
        public Item decode(Type type, Buffer value) {
            return new Item(value.toString());
        }

    }
----

`OnTextMessage` and `OnBinaryMessage` methods can also specify which codec need to be used explicitly:

[source, java]
----
@OnTextMessage(codec = MyInputCodec.class) // <1>
Item find(Item item) {
        //....
}
----
1. Specify the codec to use for both the deserialization and serialization of the message

When the serialization and deserialization must use a different codec, you can specify the codec to use for the serialization and deserialization separately:

[source, java]
----
@OnTextMessage(
        codec = MyInputCodec.class, // <1>
        outputCodec = MyOutputCodec.class // <2>
Item find(Item item) {
        //....
}
----
1. Specify the codec to use for both the deserialization of the incoming message
2. Specify the codec to use for the serialization of the outgoing message

== Handle Pong message

The `@OnPongMessage` annotation is used to consume pong messages.
A websocket endpoint must declare at most one method annotated with `@OnPongMessage`.

The method must accept a single parameter of type `Buffer`:

[source,java]
----
@OnPongMessage
void pong(Buffer data) {
    // ....
}
----

[[websocket-next-security]]
== Security

WebSocket endpoint callback methods can be secured with security annotations such as `io.quarkus.security.Authenticated`,
`jakarta.annotation.security.RolesAllowed` and other annotations listed in the xref:security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference.adoc#standard-security-annotations[Supported security annotations] documentation.

For example:

[source, java]
----
package io.quarkus.websockets.next.test.security;

import jakarta.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

import io.quarkus.security.ForbiddenException;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;
import io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnError;
import io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnOpen;
import io.quarkus.websockets.next.OnTextMessage;
import io.quarkus.websockets.next.WebSocket;

@WebSocket(path = "/end")
public class Endpoint {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity currentIdentity;

    @OnOpen
    String open() {
        return "ready";
    }

    @RolesAllowed("admin")
    @OnTextMessage
    String echo(String message) { <1>
        return message;
    }

    @OnError
    String error(ForbiddenException t) { <2>
        return "forbidden:" + currentIdentity.getPrincipal().getName();
    }
}
----
<1> The echo callback method can only be invoked if the current security identity has an `admin` role.
<2> The error handler is invoked in case of the authorization failure.

`SecurityIdentity` is initially created during a secure HTTP upgrade and associated with the websocket connection.

Currently, for an HTTP upgrade be secured, users must configure an HTTP policy protecting the HTTP upgrade path.
For example, to secure the `open()` method in the above websocket endpoint, one can add the following authentication policy:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.secured.paths=/end
quarkus.http.auth.permission.secured.policy=authenticated
----

Other options for securing HTTP upgrade requests, such as using the security annotations, will be explored in the future.

NOTE: When OpenID Connect extension is used and token expires, Quarkus automatically closes connection.

== Inspect and/or reject HTTP upgrade

To inspect an HTTP upgrade, you must provide a CDI bean implementing the `io.quarkus.websockets.next.HttpUpgradeCheck` interface.
Quarkus calls the `HttpUpgradeCheck#perform` method on every HTTP request that should be upgraded to a WebSocket connection.
Inside this method, you can perform any business logic and/or reject the HTTP upgrade.

.Example HttpUpgradeCheck
[source, java]
----
package io.quarkus.websockets.next.test;

import io.quarkus.websockets.next.HttpUpgradeCheck;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped <1>
public class ExampleHttpUpgradeCheck implements HttpUpgradeCheck {

    @Override
    public Uni<CheckResult> perform(HttpUpgradeContext ctx) {
        if (rejectUpgrade(ctx)) {
            return CheckResult.rejectUpgrade(400); <2>
        }
        return CheckResult.permitUpgrade();
    }

    private boolean rejectUpgrade(HttpUpgradeContext ctx) {
        var headers = ctx.httpRequest().headers();
        // implement your business logic in here
    }
}
----
<1> The CDI beans implementing `HttpUpgradeCheck` interface can be either `@ApplicationScoped`, `@Singleton` or `@Dependent` beans, but never the `@RequestScoped` beans.
<2> Reject the HTTP upgrade. Initial HTTP handshake ends with the 400 Bad Request response status code.

TIP: You can choose WebSocket endpoints to which the `HttpUpgradeCheck` is applied with the `HttpUpgradeCheck#appliesTo` method.
