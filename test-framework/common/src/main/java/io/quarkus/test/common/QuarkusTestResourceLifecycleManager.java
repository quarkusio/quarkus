 * annotation, which can be placed on any class in the test suite.
 *
 * These can also be loaded via a service loader mechanism, however if a service
 * loader is used it should not also be annotated as this will result in it being executed
 * twice.

 * before the ClassLoader has been setup. This means injection may not work
