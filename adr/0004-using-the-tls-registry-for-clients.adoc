== Context and Problem Statement

With https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/39825[#39825], we introduced the concept of a TLS registry in Quarkus.
The TLS registry is a way to configure TLS settings in a central place and reuse them across the application and extensions.
This is particularly useful when an application needs to connect to multiple services using TLS.

Until now, each extension has _maintained_ its own way to configure TLS settings. This leads to a lot of duplication and inconsistencies.
It's also difficult for the user to understand how to configure TLS settings in Quarkus.
The TLS registry is a way to solve this problem.

The goal of this ADR is to explain how the registry should be used by client establishing a connection to a server using TLS.

It should be noted that TLS is a sensitive and complex topic.
The TLS registry is not a silver bullet and does not solve all the problems related to TLS.
It is a way to simplify the configuration of TLS settings in Quarkus applications.

== The TLS registry

The TLS registry is an extension processing the `quarkus.tls` configuration and proposing a runtime API to access it.
Note that the configuration and the runtime API are different.
The configuration is used to define the TLS settings, while the runtime API is used to access these pre-processed settings.

hen using the options directly under `quarkus.tls.`, one configures the default (_unamed_) configuration, while using options under `quarkus.tls.<name>.` configures a _named_ configuration.
For each configuration, trust stores and key stores can be defined, as well as the default protocol, cipher suites, etc.
More details can be found in the https://quarkus.io/version/main/guides/tls-registry-reference[documentation] and in the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/tls-registry/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/tls/runtime/config/TlsBucketConfig.java[code].

At runtime, the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/tls-registry/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/tls/TlsConfigurationRegistry.java[TlsConfigurationRegistry] CDI bean gives access to the default and named _TlsConfiguration_.
These configurations have been verified during the application startup (password, alias, validity...) and are ready to be used.
https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/tls-registry/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/tls/TlsConfiguration.java[TLSConfiguration] gives access to the key store, trust store, Vert.x options, tailored `SSLContext`...
It also supports reloading the certificates.

== Configuring clients with the TLS registry

When configuring a _client_ establishing a connection to a server using TLS, the TLS registry should be used to configure the TLS settings.
The TLS settings must be defined in the `quarkus.tls.<name>.` configuration.

WARNING: Using the default configuration is going to create conflict with the server configuration, and it's is generally not a good idea to use the same configuration for the client and the server.

The client extension should use the TLS registry to retrieve the _TlsConfiguration_ and use it to configure the connection.

Thus, the client configuration must be extended with a new configuration item: `tlsConfigurationName`:

[source, java]
----
/**
 * The name of the TLS configuration to use.
 * <p>
 * If a name is configured, it uses the configuration from {@code quarkus.tls.<name>.*}
 * If a name is configured, but no TLS configuration is found with that name then an error will be thrown.
 * <p>
 * The default TLS configuration is <strong>not</strong> used by default.
 */
Optional<String> tlsConfigurationName();
----

Clients must not use the default TLS configuration, except for one case.
For backward compatibility purpose, `quarkus.tls.trust-all` should be honored when configuring clients.

== Using the TLS registry from client extensions

=== Retrieving the registry from an extension

The TLS registry is a CDI bean and can be injected in other beans.
The TLS registry is a _singleton_ CDI bean.

However, before configuring the client, you need to make sure the TLS registry is properly initialized.
The recommended approach is to inject the `TlsConfigurationRegistry tlsConfigurationRegistry` bean in a `recorder`:

[source, java]
----
BasicWebSocketConnectorImpl(Vertx vertx, Codecs codecs, ClientConnectionManager connectionManager,
     WebSocketsClientRuntimeConfig config, TlsConfigurationRegistry tlsConfigurationRegistry) {
    // ...
}
----

Another approach is to use the `TlsRegistryBuildItem` in a _processor_:

[source, java]
----
@Record(ExecutionTime.RUNTIME_INIT)
@BuildStep
public SyntheticBeanBuildItem setup(OidcBuildTimeConfig oidcBuildTimeConfig, OidcConfig oidcRunTimeConfig,
        KeycloakPolicyEnforcerConfig keycloakConfig, KeycloakPolicyEnforcerRecorder recorder,
        HttpConfiguration httpConfiguration, TlsRegistryBuildItem tlsRegistryBuildItem) {
        if (oidcBuildTimeConfig.enabled) {
            return SyntheticBeanBuildItem.configure(PolicyEnforcerResolver.class).unremovable()
                    .types(PolicyEnforcerResolver.class)
                    .supplier(recorder.setup(oidcRunTimeConfig, keycloakConfig, httpConfiguration,
                            tlsRegistryBuildItem.registry())) // Get the registry runtime value
                    .scope(Singleton.class)
                    .setRuntimeInit()
                    .done();
        }
        return null;
}
----

=== Finding the named TLS configuration

Once the TLS registry is properly passed, the client extension can use it to retrieve the named TLS configuration:

[source, java]
----
TlsConfiguration configuration = null;
Optional<TlsConfiguration> maybeTlsConfiguration = TlsConfiguration.from(tlsConfigurationRegistry,
                config.tlsConfigurationName());
if (config.tlsConfigurationName.isPresent()) {
    configuration = maybeConfiguration.get();
} else if (tlsRegistry.getDefault().isPresent() && tlsRegistry.getDefault().get().isTrustAll()) {
    defaultTrustAll = tlsRegistry.getDefault().get().isTrustAll();
    if (defaultTrustAll) {
        LOGGER.warn("The default TLS configuration is set to trust all certificates. This is a security risk."
                + "Please use a named TLS configuration for the mailer " + name + " to avoid this warning.");
    }
}
----

Also, using the _default_ `trust-all` should be avoided, and a warning should be logged if it's used.

=== Configuring a Vert.x client

When configuring a Vert.x client (HTTP client, SMTP client, gRPC client, etc.), the `TlsConfiguration` should be used to configure the client:

- The `trustStore` and `keyStore` should be set on the `options.setTrustOptions(config.getTrustStoreOptions())` and `options.setKeyCertOptions(config.getKeyStoreOptions())`. Setting the keystore enables mutual TLS (`mTLS`).
- `trustAll` can be set using `options.setTrustAll(true)`.
- The hostname verification algorithm should be configured to a sensible default (`HTTPS` for every HTTP based protocol).
To disable the hostname verification, the `NONE` value should be used.
- `TlsConfigure.getSSLOptions()` allows configuring various TLS aspect like the protocol, cipher suites, handshake, ALPN, certificate revocation lists, etc:

[source, java]
----
 SSLOptions sslOptions = configuration.getSSLOptions();
if (sslOptions != null) {
    cfg.setSslHandshakeTimeout(sslOptions.getSslHandshakeTimeout());
    cfg.setSslHandshakeTimeoutUnit(sslOptions.getSslHandshakeTimeoutUnit());
    for (String suite : sslOptions.getEnabledCipherSuites()) {
        cfg.addEnabledCipherSuite(suite);
    }
    for (Buffer buffer : sslOptions.getCrlValues()) {
        cfg.addCrlValue(buffer);
    }
    cfg.setEnabledSecureTransportProtocols(sslOptions.getEnabledSecureTransportProtocols());

}
----

- For protocol supporting SNI, the SNI should be configured using `options.setSNI(tlsConfiguration.usesSNI())`.


=== Configuring non-Vert.x clients

When configuring a non-Vert.x client, the `TLSConfiguration` provides:

- `KeyStore` objects for the key store and trust store
- A `SSLContext` object to configure the SSL context.

== Considered options

=== Continuing with the current approach

The current approach is to let each extension manage its TLS settings.
This approach leads to a lot of duplication and inconsistencies.
It's also difficult for the user to understand how to configure TLS settings in Quarkus.

Note that the TLS registry does **NOT** replace the extension-specific configuration.
It's a way to simplify the configuration of TLS settings in Quarkus applications.
The extension-specific configuration should be considered _deprecated_ and users should be invited to use the TLS registry.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* A centralized way to configure TLS settings in Quarkus applications.
* A homogenization of the TLS configuration across Quarkus extensions.
* A more complete and consistent TLS configuration.

=== Negative

* Dealing with 2 different ways to configure TLS settings in Quarkus applications until the extension-specific configurations are removed.
