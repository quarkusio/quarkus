# Maven Plugin Test Fixes

## Current Status
- Fixed JUnit Jupiter to JUnit 4 imports in LifecyclePhaseAnalyzerTest 
- Fixed Maven dependency scopes to use `provided` scope as per Mojo rules
- Fixed ambiguous assertEquals compilation error

## Remaining Issues
Several test files have compilation errors due to missing methods:
- `readMavenProject(File)` method missing in test classes
- `getLogger()` method missing from PlexusContainer interface
- `getIntrospectionResult()` method missing from EnhancedDynamicGoalAnalysisService

## Approach
These tests need to be simplified to follow Maven Plugin Testing Harness patterns using MojoRule instead of complex mocking with missing utility methods.
