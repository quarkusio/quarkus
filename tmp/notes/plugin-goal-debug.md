# Plugin Goal Detection Debug

## Current Status ‚úÖ

The Java analyzer IS working correctly for basic plugin goal detection:

### Evidence:
- **maven-script project**: Detects 2 plugin goals from `maven-compiler-plugin`
- **Debug output shows**: 
  - "Found 2 plugin goals" 
  - Proper JSON output with pluginGoals array

### Test Results:
```json
"pluginGoals": [
  {"pluginKey":"org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin","goal":"compile","phase":null,"executionId":"default","targetName":"maven-compiler:compile","targetType":"build"},
  {"pluginKey":"org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin","goal":"testCompile","phase":null,"executionId":"default","targetName":"maven-compiler:testCompile","targetType":"build"}
]
```

## Issue Found üîç

Most Quarkus projects show empty `pluginGoals` arrays because:

1. **Parent POMs**: Only contain module definitions, no actual plugins
2. **Plugin Inheritance**: Quarkus plugins are often defined in parent POMs and inherited
3. **Detection Logic**: Our dependency-based detection should work but needs verification

## Real Quarkus Project with Plugins

Found a good test case: `/integration-tests/main/pom.xml`
- Has Quarkus dependencies: ‚úÖ
- Has Quarkus plugin with executions: ‚úÖ
- Should trigger both plugin execution detection AND dependency-based detection

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>build</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

## Next Steps

Need to test analyzer on this specific project to verify Quarkus goal detection works.
