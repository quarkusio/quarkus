= Quarkus - Using OpenID Connect and Keycloak to Centralize Authorization

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can authorize a bearer token access to protected resources using https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html[Keycloak Authorization Services].

The `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` extension is based on `quarkus-oidc` and provides a policy enforcer that enforces access to protected resources based on permissions managed by Keycloak and currently can only be used with the Quarkus link:security-openid-connect[OIDC service applications].
It provides a flexible and dynamic authorization capability based on Resource-Based Access Control.
In other words, instead of explicitly enforcing access based on some specific access control mechanism (e.g.: RBAC), you just check whether or not a request is allowed to access a resource based on its name, identifier or URI.

By externalizing authorization from your application, you are allowed to protect your applications using different access control mechanisms as well as avoid re-deploying your application every time your security requirements change, where Keycloak will be acting as a centralized authorization service from where your protected resources and their associated permissions are managed.

See the link:security-openid-connect[Using OpenID Connect to Protect Service Applications] guide for more information about `Bearer Token` authentication mechanism. It is important to realize that it is the `Bearer Token` authentication mechanism which does the authentication and creates a security identity - while the `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` extension is responsible for applying a Keycloak Authorization Policy to this identity based on the current request path and other policy settings.

If you are already familiar with Keycloak, youâ€™ll notice that the extension is basically another adapter implementation but specific for Quarkus applications.
Otherwise, you can find more information in the Keycloak https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_enforcer_overview[documentation].

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 11+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq tool]
* https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html[Keycloak]
* Docker

== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple microservice which offers two endpoints:

* `/api/users/me`
* `/api/admin`

These endpoints are protected and can only be accessed if a client is sending a bearer token along with the request, which must be valid (e.g.: signature, expiration and audience) and trusted by the microservice.

The bearer token is issued by a Keycloak Server and represents the subject to which the token was issued for.
For being an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, the token also references the client acting on behalf of the user.

The `/api/users/me` endpoint can be accessed by any user with a valid token.
As a response, it returns a JSON document with details about the user where these details are obtained from the information carried on the token.
This endpoint is protected with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and only users granted with the `user` role can access this endpoint.

The `/api/admin` endpoint is protected with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and only users granted with the `admin` role can access it.

This is a very simple example using RBAC policies to govern access to your resources.
However, Keycloak supports other types of policies that you can use to perform even more fine-grained access control.
By using this example, you'll see that your application is completely decoupled from your authorization policies with enforcement being purely based on the accessed resource.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Project

First, we need a new project.
Create a new project with the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart \
    -Dextensions="oidc,keycloak-authorization,resteasy-jackson" \
    -DnoExamples
cd security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart
----

This command generates a Maven project, importing the `keycloak-authorization` extension which is an implementation of a Keycloak Adapter for Quarkus applications and provides all the necessary capabilities to integrate with a Keycloak Server and perform bearer token authorization.

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `oidc` and `keycloak-authorization` extensions
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="oidc,keycloak-authorization"
----

This will add the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-keycloak-authorization</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Let's start by implementing the `/api/users/me` endpoint.
As you can see from the source code below it is just a regular JAX-RS resource:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.keycloak.authorization;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.cache.NoCache;

import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;

@Path("/api/users")
public class UsersResource {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity identity;

    @GET
    @Path("/me")
    @NoCache
    public User me() {
        return new User(identity);
    }

    public static class User {

        private final String userName;

        User(SecurityIdentity identity) {
            this.userName = identity.getPrincipal().getName();
        }

        public String getUserName() {
            return userName;
        }
    }
}
----

The source code for the `/api/admin` endpoint is also very simple:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.keycloak.authorization;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/api/admin")
@Authenticated
public class AdminResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String admin() {
        return "granted";
    }
}
----

Note that we did not define any annotation such as `@RoleAllowed` to explicitly enforce access to a resource.
The extension will be responsible to map the URIs of the protected resources you have in Keycloak and evaluate the permissions accordingly, granting or denying access depending on the permissions that will be granted by Keycloak.

=== Configuring the application

The OpenID Connect extension allows you to define the adapter configuration using the `application.properties` file which should be located at the `src/main/resources` directory.

[source,properties]
----
# OIDC Configuration
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://localhost:8543/auth/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=backend-service
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.tls.verification=none

# Enable Policy Enforcement
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.enable=true
----

NOTE: By default, applications using the `quarkus-oidc` extension are marked as a `service` type application (see `quarkus.oidc.application-type`). This extension also supports only  `web-app` type applications but only if the access token returned as part of the authorization code grant response is marked as a source of roles: `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken` (`web-app` type applications check ID token roles by default).

== Starting and Configuring the Keycloak Server

To start a Keycloak Server you can use Docker and just run the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 8180:8080 -p 8543:8443 {keycloak-docker-image}
----

You should be able to access your Keycloak Server at http://localhost:8180/auth[localhost:8180/auth] or https://localhost:8543/auth[localhost:8543/auth].

Log in as the `admin` user to access the Keycloak Administration Console.
Username should be `admin` and password `admin`.

Import the {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] to create a new realm.
For more details, see the Keycloak documentation about how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_create-realm[create a new realm].

== Running and Using the Application

=== Running in Developer Mode

To run the microservice in dev mode, use `./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev`.

=== Running in JVM Mode

When you're done playing with "dev-mode" you can run it as a standard Java application.

First compile it:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package
----

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

=== Running in Native Mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code: no modifications required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your production environment, as the runtime technology is included in the produced binary, and optimized to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compilation will take a bit longer, so this step is disabled by default; let's build again by enabling the `native` profile:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative
----

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/security-keycloak-authorization-quickstart-runner
----

== Testing the Application

The application is using bearer token authorization and the first thing to do is obtain an access token from the Keycloak Server in order to access the application resources:

[source,bash]
----
export access_token=$(\
    curl --insecure -X POST https://localhost:8543/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=alice&password=alice&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 )
----

The example above obtains an access token for user `alice`.

Any user is allowed to access the
`http://localhost:8080/api/users/me` endpoint
which basically returns a JSON payload with details about the user.

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -X GET \
  http://localhost:8080/api/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer "$access_token
----

The `http://localhost:8080/api/admin` endpoint can only be accessed by users with the `admin` role.
If you try to access this endpoint with the previously issued access token, you should get a `403` response from the server.

[source,bash]
----
 curl -v -X GET \
   http://localhost:8080/api/admin \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer "$access_token
----

In order to access the admin endpoint you should obtain a token for the `admin` user:

[source,bash]
----
export access_token=$(\
    curl --insecure -X POST https://localhost:8543/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token \
    --user backend-service:secret \
    -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    -d 'username=admin&password=admin&grant_type=password' | jq --raw-output '.access_token' \
 )
----

== Checking Permissions Programmatically

In some cases, you may want to programmatically check whether or not a request is granted to access a protected resource. By 
injecting a `SecurityIdentity` instance in your beans, you are allowed to check permissions as follows:

[source,java]
----
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

@Path("/api/protected")
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity identity;
    
    
    @GET
    public Uni<List<Permission>> get() {
        return identity.checkPermission(new AuthPermission("{resource_name}")).onItem()
                .transform(granted -> {
                    if (granted) {
                        return identity.getAttribute("permissions");
                    }
                    throw new ForbiddenException();
                });
    }
}
----

== Injecting the Authorization Client

In some cases, you may want to use the https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/#_service_client_api[Keycloak Authorization Client Java API] to perform
specific operations like managing resources and obtaining permissions directly from Keycloak. For that, you can inject a
`AuthzClient` instance into your beans as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class ProtectedResource {
    @Inject
    AuthzClient authzClient;
}
----

== Mapping Protected Resources

By default, the extension is going to fetch resources on-demand from Keycloak where their `URI` are used to map the resources in your application that should be protected.

If you want to disable this behavior and fetch resources during startup, you can use the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.lazy-load-paths=false
----

Note that, depending on how many resources you have in Keycloak the time taken to fetch them may impact your application startup time. 

== More About Configuring Protected Resources

In the default configuration, Keycloak is responsible for managing the roles and deciding who can access which routes. 

To configure the protected routes using the `@RolesAllowed` annotation or the `application.properties` file, check the link:security-openid-connect[Using OpenID Connect Adapter to Protect JAX-RS Applications] and link:security-authorization[Security Authorization] guides. For more details, check the link:security[Security guide].

== Access to Public Resources

If you'd like to access a public resource without `quarkus-keycloak-authorization` trying to apply its policies to it then you need to create a `permit` HTTP Policy configuration in `application.properties` as documented in the link:security-authorization[Security Authorization] guide.

Disabling a policy check using a Keycloak Authorization Policy such as:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/public
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.enforcement-mode=DISABLED
----

is no longer required.

If you'd like to block an access to the public resource to anonymous users then you can create an enforcing Keycloak Authorization Policy:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/public-enforcing
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.enforcement-mode=ENFORCING
----

Note only the default tenant configuration applies when controlling an anonymous access to the public resource is required.

== Multi-Tenancy

It is possible to configure multiple policy enforcer configurations, one per each tenant, similarly to how it can be done for link:security-openid-connect-multitenancy[Multi-Tenant OpenId Connect Service Applications].

For example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.enable=true

# Default Tenant
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret

quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.enforcement-mode=PERMISSIVE
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.name=Permission Resource
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/permission
quarkus.keycloak.policy-enforcer.paths.1.claim-information-point.claims.static-claim=static-claim

# Service Tenant

quarkus.oidc.service-tenant.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.service-tenant.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.service-tenant.credentials.secret=secret

quarkus.keycloak.service-tenant.policy-enforcer.enforcement-mode=PERMISSIVE
quarkus.keycloak.service-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.name=Permission Resource Service
quarkus.keycloak.service-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/permission
quarkus.keycloak.service-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.claim-information-point.claims.static-claim=static-claim


# WebApp Tenant

quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.application-type=web-app
quarkus.oidc.webapp-tenant.roles.source=accesstoken

quarkus.keycloak.webapp-tenant.policy-enforcer.enforcement-mode=PERMISSIVE
quarkus.keycloak.webapp-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.name=Permission Resource WebApp
quarkus.keycloak.webapp-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.path=/api/permission
quarkus.keycloak.webapp-tenant.policy-enforcer.paths.1.claim-information-point.claims.static-claim=static-claim
----

== Configuration Reference

The configuration is based on the official https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/authorization_services/index.html#_enforcer_filter[Keycloak Policy Enforcer Configuration]. If you are looking for more details about the different configuration options, please take a look at this documentation,
