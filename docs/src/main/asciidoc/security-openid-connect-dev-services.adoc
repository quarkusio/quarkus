= Dev Services for OpenId Connect (OIDC)

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide covers the Dev Services for OpenId Connect (OIDC) Keycloak provider and explains how to support other OpenId Connect providers.

== Introduction

Quarkus introduces an experimental `Dev Services For Keycloak` feature which is enabled by default when the `quarkus-oidc` extension is started in dev mode with `mvn quarkus:dev` and when the integration tests are running in test mode, but only when no `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` property is configured.
It starts a Keycloak container for both the dev and/or test modes and initializes them by registering the existing Keycloak realm or creating a new realm with the client and users for you to start developing your Quarkus application secured by Keycloak immediately. It will restart the container when the `application.properties` or the realm file changes have been detected.

Additionally, link:dev-ui[Dev UI] available at http://localhost:8080/q/dev[/q/dev] supports this feature with a Keycloak specific page which helps to acquire the tokens from Keycloak and test your Quarkus application.

== Dev Services for Keycloak

Start your application without configuring `quarkus.oidc` properties in `application.properties`. You will see in the console something similar to:

[source,shell]

$ mvn quarkus:dev

...
----

The `quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:14.0.0` Keycloak image is used by default to start a container. `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.image-name` can be used to change the Keycloak image used.

Note that by default, `Dev Services for Keycloak` will not start a new container if it finds a container with a `quarkus-dev-service-keycloak` label and connect to it if this label's value matches the value of the `quarkus.keycloak.devservces.service-name` property (default value is `quarkus`). In such cases you will see a slighty different output:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn quarkus:dev

2021-08-27 18:42:43,530 INFO  [io.qua.dev.com.ContainerLocator] (build-15) Dev Services container found: 48fee151a31ddfe32c39965be8f61108587b25ed2f66cdc18bb926d9e2e570c5 (quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:14.0.0). Connecting to: 0.0.0.0:32797.
2021-08-27 18:42:43,600 INFO  [io.qua.oid.dep.dev.key.KeycloakDevServicesProcessor] (build-15) Dev Services for Keycloak started.
...
----

Note that you can disable sharing the containers with `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.shared=false`.

Now open the main link:http://localhost:8080/q/dev[Dev UI page] and you will see the `OpenId Connect Card` linking to a `Keycloak` page:

image::dev-ui-oidc-keycloak-card.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Card,role="center"]

Click on the `Provider: Keycloak` link and you will see a Keycloak page which will be presented slightly differently depending on how `Dev Services for Keycloak` feature has been configured.

=== Developing Service Applications

By default the Keycloak page can be used to support the development of a link:security-openid-connect[Quarkus OIDC service application].

==== Authorization Code Grant

If you set `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.grant.type=code` in `applicatin.properties` (this is a default value) then an `authorization_code` grant will be used to acquire both access and ID tokens. Using this grant is recommended to emulate a typical flow where a `Single Page Application` acquires the tokens and uses them to access Quarkus services.

First you will see an option to `Log into Single Page Application`:

image::dev-ui-keycloak-sign-in-to-spa.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Keycloak Page - Log into Single Page Application,role="center"]

Next, after you select this option, you will be redirected to Keycloak to authenticate, example, as `alice:alice` and then returned to the page representing the SPA:  

image::dev-ui-keycloak-test-service-from-spa.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Keycloak Single Page Application,role="center"]

You can view the acquired access and ID tokens, for example:

image::dev-ui-keycloak-decoded-tokens.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Keycloak Decoded Tokens View,role="center"]

This view shows the encoded JWT token on the left hand side and highlights the headers (red colour), payload/claims (green colour) and signature (blue colour). It also shows the decoded JWT token on the right hand side where you can see the header and claim names and their values.

Next test the service with either the current access or ID token. SPA usually sends the access tokens to the application endpoints but there could be cases where the ID tokens are forwarded to the application frontends for them to be aware about the user who is currently logged into SPA.

Finally you can select a `Log Out` image::dev-ui-keycloak-logout.png option if you'd like to log out and authenticate to Keycloak as a different user.

[NOTE]
====
You may need to register a redirect URI for the authorization code flow initiated by Dev UI for Keycloak to work because Keycloak may enforce that the authenticated users are redirected only to the configured redirect URI. It is recommended to do in production to avoid the users being redirected to the wrong endpoints which might happen if the correct `redirect_uri` parameter in the authentication request URI has been manipulated.

If Keycloak does enforce it then you will see an authentication error informing you that the `redirect_uri` value is wrong.

In this case select the `Keycloak Admin` option in the right top corner, login as `admin:admin`, select the test realm and the client which Dev UI for Keycloak is configured with and add `http://localhost:8080/q/dev/io.quarkus.quarkus-oidc/provider` to `Valid Redirect URIs`. If you used `-Dquarkus.http.port` when starting Quarkus then change `8080` to the value of `quarkus.http.port`.

If the container is shared between multiple applications running on different ports then you will need to register `redirect_uri` values for each of these applications.

You can set the `redirect_uri` value to `*` only for the test purposes, especially when the containers are shared between multiple applications.

`*` `redirect_uri` value is set by `Dev Services for Keycloak` when it creates a default realm, if no custom realm is imported.
====

==== Implicit Grant

If you set `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.grant.type=implicit` in `applicatin.properties` then an `implicit` grant will be used to acquire both access and ID tokens. Use this grant for emulating a `Single Page Application` only if the authorization code grant does not work (for example, a client is configured in Keycloak to support an implicit grant, etc).

==== Password Grant

If you set `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.grant.type=password` in `applicatin.properties` then you will see a screen like this one:

image::dev-ui-keycloak-password-grant.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Keycloak Page - Password Grant,role="center"]

Enter a registered user name, a relative service endpoint path, click on `Test Service` and you will see a status code such as `200`, `403`, `401` or `404` printed.

You will also see in the Dev UI console something similar to:

[source,shell]
----
2021-07-19 17:58:11,407 INFO  [io.qua.oid.dep.dev.key.KeycloakDevConsolePostHandler] (security-openid-connect-quickstart-dev.jar) (DEV Console action) Using password grant to get a token from 'http://localhost:32818/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token' for user 'alice' in realm 'quarkus' with client id 'quarkus-app'

----

A token is acquired from Keycloak using a `password` grant and is sent to the service endpoint.

==== Client Credentials Grant

If you set `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.grant.type=client` then a `client_credentials` grant will be used to acquire a token, with the page showing no `User` field in this case:

image::dev-ui-keycloak-client-credentials-grant.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Keycloak Page - Client Credentials Grant,role="center"]

You can test the service the same way as with the `Password` grant.

=== Developing OpenId Connect Web App Applications

If you develop a link:security-openid-connect-web-authentication[Quarkus OIDC web-app application] then you should set `quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app` in `application.properties` before starting the application.

You will see a screen like this one:

image::dev-ui-keycloak-sign-in-to-service.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Keycloak Sign In,role="center"]

Set a relative service endpoint path, click on `Sign In To Service` and you will be redirected to Keycloak to enter a username and password in a new browser tab and get a response from the Quarkus application.

=== Running the tests

You can run the tests against a Keycloak container started in a test mode in a link:continuous-testing[Continuous Testing] mode.

It is also recommended to run the integration tests against Keycloak using `Dev Services for Keycloak`.
Please see link:security-openid-connect#integration-testing-keycloak-devservices[Testing OpenId Connect Service Applications with Dev Services] and link:security-openid-connect-web-authentication#integration-testing-keycloak-devservices[Testing OpenId Connect WebApp Applications with Dev Services] for more information.

=== Keycloak Initialization

You do not need to configure `quarkus-oidc-keycloak` to start developing your Quarkus Keycloak `OIDC` applications with the only exception being that `quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app` has to be set in `application.properties` to give the `Keycloak` page a hint it needs to show an option to `Sign In To Service`.

By default, the `quarkus`, `quarkus-app` client with a `secret` password, `alice` and `bob` users (with the passwords matching the names), and `user` and `admin` roles are created, with `alice` given both `admin` and `user` roles and `bob` - the `user` role. 

Usernames, secrets and their roles can be customized with `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.users` (the map which contains usernames and secrets) and `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.roles` (the map which contains user names and comma separated role values).

`quarkus.oidc.client-id` and `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret` can be used to customize the client id and secret.

However it is likely your Keycloak configuration may be more complex and require setting more properties.

This is why `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.realm-path` is always checked first before trying to initialize Keycloak with the default or configured realm, client, user and roles properties. If the realm file exists on the file system or classpath then only this realm will be used to initialize Keycloak.

Also the Keycloak page offers an option to `Sign In To Keycloak To Configure Realms` using a `Keycloak Admin` option in the right top corner:

image::dev-ui-keycloak-admin.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Keycloak Page - Keycloak Admin,role="center"]

Sign in to Keycloak as `admin:admin` in order to further customize the realm properties or create a new realm, export the realm and have Keycloak initialized with the custom realm after a restart.

Note that even if you initialize Keycloak from a realm file, it is still needed to set the `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.realm-name` property for `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` to be calculated correctly. Setting the `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.users` property is needed if a `password` grant is used to acquire the tokens to test the OIDC `service` applications.

== Disable Dev Services for Keycloak

`Dev Services For Keycloak` will not be activated if either `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` is already initialized or the defaut OIDC tenant is disabled with `quarkus.oidc.tenant.enabled=false`, irrespectively of whether you work with Keycloak or not.

If you prefer not to have a `Dev Services for Keycloak` container started or do not work with Keycloak then you can also disable this feature with `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.enabled=false` - it will only be necessary if you expect to start `quarkus:dev` without `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url`.

The main Dev UI page will include an empty `OpenId Connect Card` when `Dev Services for Keycloak` is disabled:

image::dev-ui-oidc-card.png[alt=Dev UI OpenId Connect Card,role="center"]

== Dev Services Support for other OpenId Connect Providers

Your custom extension would need to extend `quarkus-oidc` only and add the dependencies required to support your provider to the extension's `deployment` module only.

The build step dealing with the `Dev Services` should additionally register two runtime properties into the "io.quarkus.quarkus-oidc" namespace: `oidcProviderName` (for example, `Google`) and `oidcProviderUrlBase` (for example: `mycompany.devservices-google`) for the `OpenId Connect Card` to link to the Dev UI page representing your provider, for example:

[source,java]
----
package io.quarkus.oidc.okta.runtime;

import java.util.function.Supplier;

import io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.Recorder;

// This simple recorder is the only code which will be located in the extension's `runtime` module
@Recorder
public class OktaDevServicesRecorder {

    public Supplier<String> getProviderName() {
        return new Supplier<String>() {

            @Override
            public String get() {
                return "OKTA";
            }
        };
    }

    public Supplier<String> getProviderUrlBase() {
        return new Supplier<String>() {

            @Override
            public String get() {
                return "io.quarkus" + "." + "quarkus-oidc-okta";
            }
        };
    }
}


package io.quarkus.oidc.okta.deployment.devservices;

import static io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.ExecutionTime.RUNTIME_INIT;

import java.util.Optional;

import io.quarkus.deployment.IsDevelopment;
import io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.BuildProducer;
import io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.BuildStep;
import io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.Consume;
import io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.Record;
import io.quarkus.deployment.builditem.RuntimeConfigSetupCompleteBuildItem;
import io.quarkus.devconsole.spi.DevConsoleRouteBuildItem;
import io.quarkus.devconsole.spi.DevConsoleRuntimeTemplateInfoBuildItem;

public class OktaDevConsoleProcessor {

    @BuildStep(onlyIf = IsDevelopment.class)
    @Record(value = RUNTIME_INIT)
    public void setOidcProviderProperties(BuildProducer<DevConsoleRuntimeTemplateInfoBuildItem> provider,
            OktaDevServicesRecorder recorder,
            Optional<DevServicesConfigBuildItem> configProps) {
        if (configProps.isPresent()) {
            provider.produce(new DevConsoleRuntimeTemplateInfoBuildItem("io.quarkus", "quarkus-oidc", "oidcProviderName",
                    recorder.getProviderName()));
            provider.produce(new DevConsoleRuntimeTemplateInfoBuildItem("io.quarkus", "quarkus-oidc", "oidcProviderUrlBase",
                    recorder.getProviderUrlBase()));
        }
    }
}

----

Additionally, the extension should produce a `io.quarkus.oidc.deployment.devservices.OidcProviderBuildItem` to disable the default `Dev Services for Keycloak`, instead of the users having to type `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.enabled=false`.

Please follow the link:dev-ui[Dev UI] tutorial as well as check the `extensions/oidc/deployment` sources for more ideas.
