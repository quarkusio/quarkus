# Test Failures Analysis

## Summary
The Maven plugin tests are failing due to NullPointerException issues in the ExecutionPlanAnalysisService constructor after the Kotlin rewrite.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Constructor Parameter Validation
- ExecutionPlanAnalysisService constructor is receiving null parameters that are marked as non-null in Kotlin
- Affected parameters: `defaultLifecycles`, `lifecycleExecutor`, `log`

### 2. Test Stats
- Tests run: 76
- Failures: 1  
- Errors: 19
- Total issues: 20 test failures

### 3. Affected Test Classes
- ExecutionPlanAnalysisServiceTest
- MavenUtilsTest  
- TargetDependencyServiceTest

## Root Cause
The conversion from Java to Kotlin introduced stricter null safety. Parameters that could be null in Java are now marked as non-null in Kotlin, causing NPEs during test setup.

## Next Steps
1. Review ExecutionPlanAnalysisService constructor
2. Fix null parameter handling in tests
3. Update test setup to provide non-null dependencies
