# Maven Executor Timeout Removal

## Changes Made

Successfully removed the timeout option from the Maven executor to ensure it never times out during execution.

### Files Modified

1. **schema.json** (`/maven-plugin/src/executors/maven-batch/schema.json:31-34`)
   - Removed the `timeout` property definition
   - No longer accepts timeout configuration

2. **executor.ts** (`/maven-plugin/src/executors/maven-batch/executor.ts`)
   - Removed `timeout?: number` from `MavenBatchExecutorOptions` interface
   - Removed timeout parameter from options destructuring (lines 49, 307)
   - Removed `timeout: timeout` from both `execSync` calls (lines 116, 343)

## Technical Details

The Maven executor now runs without any timeout constraints:
- Single project execution: `execSync` called without timeout parameter
- Multi-project batch execution: `execSync` called without timeout parameter
- Maintains 10MB buffer limit for output handling
- All other functionality preserved

## Testing

- Maven compilation completed successfully
- E2E test setup ran without issues (Java components compiled, dependencies resolved)
- Test timeout was from test runner, not Maven executor itself

## Impact

Maven goals can now run indefinitely without being terminated by timeout constraints, which is appropriate for potentially long-running build processes.
