= Contribute to Quarkus documentation
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: contributing
:fn-diataxis: footnote:diataxis[Procida, D. Di√°taxis documentation framework. https://diataxis.fr/]

Contribute to the documentation by using the recommended steps, workflow, and style guidance to ensure the content successfully renders on the Quarkus website portal.

== Prerequisites

Quarkus docs use link:https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] markup.

We suggest you have the following materials nearby:

- An editor or IDE that provides syntax highlighting and previews for AsciiDoc, either natively or with a plugin.
- The https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc syntax reference]
- The xref:{doc-guides}/doc-reference.adoc[Quarkus documentation reference] for the required syntax, preferred style, and other conventions.

== Locate the source files for Quarkus docs

- AsciiDoc files are in the `src/main/asciidoc` directory within the `docs` module of the {quarkus-base-url}/tree/main/docs[Quarkus GitHub repository].
- Configuration documentation is generated from JavaDoc comments in Java source files.
- Java, YAML, and other source files can also be xref:doc-reference.adoc#reference-source-code[referenced] by AsciiDoc files.
- The link:https://quarkus.io/guides/[Quarkus documentation] menu page, also known as the doc index page, is sourced in the link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io[quarkusio.github.io] repository.


== Create Quarkus content in AsciiDoc

To ensure that your content shows up correctly on the link:https://quarkus.io/guides/[Quarkus documentation home page], use the following steps:

. Decide on a content type that best fits the content that you are contributing.
+
TIP: To help you decide, see the content type descriptions in xref:{doc-guides}/doc-reference.adoc#titles-and-headings[Titles and headings] on the "About Quarkus documentation" page.
+
. Go to the `src/main/asciidoc/_templates` directory, and make a copy of the relevant template for the content type you have chosen. Be sure to:
** Use the filename syntax of`<category>-<titlekeyword>-<titlekeyword>-<content-type>.adoc`. For example, `security-basic-authentication-tutorial.adoc`.
** Save the file to the `docs/src/main/asciidoc` folder in the `quarkus` repository.
. Set the minimum required header information as outlined in the following example:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
[id="security-basic-authentication-howto"] <1>
= Secure a Quarkus application with basic authentication <2>
include::_attributes.adoc[] <3>
:categories: security <4>
----
+
<1> Set the `id` value to be the same as the file name but without the extension. You can shorten this if the file name is too long.
<2> For information about how to create a good title for each content type, see xref:{doc-guides}/doc-reference.adoc#titles-and-headings[Titles and headings] on the "About Quarkus documentation" page.
<3> The `_attributes.adoc` include is required to ensure that attributes get resolved, the table of contents is generated, and content renders in the website portal. 
<4> Set at least one category to ensure that the content is findable on the link:https://quarkus.io/guides/[Quarkus documentation home page].

For more information about the minimum header requirements, see xref:{doc-guides}/doc-reference.adoc#document-structure[Document structure] on the "About Quarkus documentation" page.

== Retire and redirect an existing Quarkus AsciiDoc source file

As content evolves, you might want to restructure an existing piece of Quarkus content into one or more content types and retire the existing AsciiDoc source file.

If you are retiring or renaming a published Quarkus AsciiDoc source file, ensure that the restructure does not break existing bookmarks and links to original content. 
Configure a URL redirect in the link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io/[Quarkus.io Website] GitHub repository by using the following steps:

. Switch to the link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io/tree/develop/_redirects/guides[quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io] repository, and open the `_redirects/guides` folder.
. Create a redirection file in Markdown format with a filename that matches the original AsciiDoc source filename that you want to retire. 
. Add the following contents to the Markdown redirection file:
+
[source,markdown]
---
permalink: /guides/<original_asciidoc_filename>/index.html // <1>
newUrl: /guides/<new_asciidoc_filename> // <2>
---
+
Where:
<1> Is the name of the original AsciiDoc source file that you are retiring.
<2> Is the name of the AsciiDoc source file that you want to redirect to.

== Preview and build Quarkus documentation

AsciiDoc syntax highlighting and the preview provided by an IDE may be enough for minor documentation changes.
When you make significant changes or updates to generated configuration documentation, build the `docs` module locally and run the Vale linter as outlined below.

include::{includes}/compile-quarkus-quickly.adoc[tag=quickly-install-docs]

This will produce:

- Generated AsciiDoc (`adoc` files) describing configuration properties in the `target/asciidoc/generated/config/` directory.
- AsciiDoc output (`html` files) in the `docs/target/generated-docs/` directory.
- YAML files containing metadata for all documents individually (`docs/target/indexByFile.yaml`) and grouped by document type (`target/indexByType.yaml`). 
- YAML files that list metadata errors by file (`docs/target/errorsByFile.yaml`) and by error type (`docs/target/errorsByType.yaml`)

Review the resulting output and fix any issues before you submit your changes in a PR for review.

As you make changes, you can rebuild the `docs` module specifically to update the generated HTML:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw -f docs clean install
----

[NOTE]
====
When updating extension configuration:

. Revise the Javadoc in the extension
. Build the extension to regenerate content in `target/asciidoc/generated/config/`
. Build the `docs` module to view the rendered results.
====

== Lint documentation changes with Vale

Our builds use https://vale.sh[Vale] to check grammar, style, and word usage in the English versions of our documents.
The configuration for vale is in the `docs/.vale` directory.

NOTE: The Vale configuration file is `docs/.vale/vale.ini`.

=== Containerized Vale

This approach requires a working container runtime (Docker or xref:podman.adoc[Podman]). 

The `docs` module has a JUnit 5 test that will run the Vale linter in a container (using https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers]). 
It verifies both Quarkus document metadata and Vale style rules. 

Run the test in one of the following ways:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw -f docs test -Dvale -DvaleLevel=suggestion # <1>
./mvnw -f docs test -Dvale=git -DvaleLevel=warning # <2>
./mvnw -f docs test -Dvale='doc-.*' -DvaleLevel=error # <3>
----
<1> Run the Vale linter for all `*.adoc` files in the `src/main/asciidoc` directory of the `docs` module.
Include suggestions, warnings, and errors in the results.
<2> Run the Vale linter for any modified `*.adoc` files in the `docs` module (`git status`).
Include warnings and errors in the results.
<3> Run the Vale linter for `*.adoc` files that match the regular expression (Java Pattern syntax).
Include errors in the results.


=== Use the Vale CLI

If you install the https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/[install the Vale CLI], you must specify the configuration file along with the directory or list of files to scan:

[source,shell]
----
vale --config=docs/.vale/vale.ini --minAlertLevel=warning docs/src/main/asciidoc
----

See the https://vale.sh/manual/[Vale CLI Manual] for details.

=== Vale IDE plugins

https://vale.sh/docs/integrations/guide/[Vale IDE integrations] require the Vale CLI to be installed.

Each has it's own configuration requirements. The Visual Studio Code IDE extension, for example, requires two workspace settings:

[source,json]
----
"vale.valeCLI.config": "/path/to/quarkus/docs/.vale/vale.ini",
"vale.valeCLI.path": "/path/to/vale"
----

== Creating pull requests for doc updates

:gh-pull-requests-fork: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork
:gh-about-forks: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks

Submit your proposed changes to the core Quarkus docs by {gh-pull-requests-fork}[creating a pull request] against the `main` branch of the Quarkus repository from your own {gh-about-forks}[repository fork].

Reviews for code and documentation have different (but overlapping) participants.
To simplify collaborative review, either isolate changes to docs in their own PRs,
or ensure that the PR has a single, focused purpose. For example:

- Create a single PR that adds a configuration option for an extension and updates related materials (how-to, reference) to explain the change.
- Create a single PR for related changes to a group of documents, some examples:
correcting the usage of a term, correcting a recurring error, or moving common content into a shared file.
- If there are extensive code changes and documentation changes,
create a separate PR for the documentation changes and include the relationship in the issue description.

Pull requests that contain changes to documentation will have the `area/documentation` label added automatically.

== Automatic style checking on the PR diff

The Vale linter job automatically runs when a PR is created or updated.
If your content updates do not align with the key style or terminology preferences of the Quarkus community, the updated line on the diff tab gets annotated with the Vale suggestion, warning, or error.
To ensure that your content gets approved, fix the linter errors, warnings, and suggestions.

We welcome your feedback on the Quarkus documentation style guidelines.

If you disagree with the Vale results, be sure to add the yellow PR label `needs-vale-rule-tweak`.
