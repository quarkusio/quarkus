= {project-name} - Contexts and Dependency Injection

{project-name} DI solution is based on the http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html[Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java 2.0, window="_blank"] specification.
However, it is not a full CDI implementation verified by the TCK.
Only a subset of the CDI features is implemented - see also <<supported_features,the list of supported features>> and <<limitations,the list of limitations>>.

NOTE: Most of the existing CDI code should work just fine but there are some small differences which follow from the {project-name} architecture and goals.

== Bean Discovery

Bean discovery in CDI is a complex process which involves legacy deployment structures and accessibility requirements of the underlying module architecture.
{project-name} is using a simplified bean discovery.
There is only one bean archive with `annotated` bean discovery mode and no visibility boundaries.

The bean archive is synthesized from:

* the application,
* application dependencies that contain a `beans.xml` descriptor or a generated Jandex index (`META-INF/jandex.idx`),
* and {project-name} integration code.

Bean classes that don't have a http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html#bean_defining_annotations[bean defining annotation, window="_blank"] are not discovered.
This behavior is defined by CDI.
But producer methods and fields and observer methods are discovered even if the declaring class is not annotated with a bean defining annotation (this behavior is different to what is defined in CDI).
In fact, the declaring bean classes are considered annotated with `@Dependent`. 

NOTE: {project-name} extension may declare additional discovery rules. For example `@Scheduled` business methods are registered even if the declaring class is not annotated with a bean defining annotation.


== Private Members

{project-name} is designed with Substrate VM in mind.
One of the limitations is the usage of https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/LIMITATIONS.md#user-content-reflection[Reflection, window="_blank"].
Substrate VM does support reflective calls but for a price of a bigger native image.
{project-name} must use reflection fallback to access private members.
That's why {project-name} users are encouraged __not to use private members__ in their beans.
This involves injection fields, constructors and initializers, observer methods, producer methods and fields, disposers and interceptor methods.

You can use for example package-private modifiers:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CounterBean {

    @Inject
    CounterService counterService; // <1>
    
    void onMessage(@Observes Event msg) { // <2>
    }
}
----
1. A package-private injection field
2. A package-private observer method

Or constructor injection:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CounterBean {

    private final CounterService service;

    CounterBean() { // <1>
    }

    @Inject
    CounterBean(CounterService service) { <2>
      this.service = service;
    }
}
----
1. Dummy constructor needed for CDI beans with a normal scope
2. A package-private constructor injection

[[limitations]]
== Limitations

* `@SessionScoped` and `@ConversationScoped` are not supported
* Custom scopes and contexts are not supported
* Decorators are not supported
* Portable Extensions are not supported
* `BeanManager` - only the following methods are implemented: `getBeans()`, `createCreationalContext()`, `getReference()`, `resolve()`, `getContext()`, `getEvent()` and `createInstance()`
* Specialization is not supported
* `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored
* Passivation and passivating scopes are not supported
* Transitive interceptor bindings and interceptor methods on superclasses are not implemented yet

[[portable_extensions]]
== Portable Extensions

{project-name} incorporates build-time optimizations in order to provide instant startup and low memory footprint.
The downside of this approach is that CDI Portable Extensions cannot be supported.
Nevertheless, most of the functionality can be achieved using {project-name} link:extension-authors-guide.html[extensions].
