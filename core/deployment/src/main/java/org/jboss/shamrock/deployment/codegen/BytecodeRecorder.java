/**
 * A class that can be used to record invocations to bytecode so they can be replayed later. This is done through the
 * use of class templates and recording proxies.
 * <p>
 * A class template is simple a stateless class with a no arg constructor. This template will contain the runtime logic
 * used to bootstrap the various frameworks.
 * <p>
 * A recording proxy is a proxy of a template that records all invocations on the template, and then writes out a sequence
 * of java bytecode that performs the same invocations.
 *
 * There are some limitations on what can be recorded. Only the following objects are allowed as parameters to
 * recording proxies:
 *
 * - primitives
 * - String
 * - Class (see {@link #classProxy(String)} to handle classes that are not loadable at generation time)
 * - Objects with a no-arg constructor and getter/setters for all properties
 * - Any arbitrary object via the {@link #registerSubstitution(Class, Class, Class)} mechanism
 * - arrays, lists and maps of the above
 *
