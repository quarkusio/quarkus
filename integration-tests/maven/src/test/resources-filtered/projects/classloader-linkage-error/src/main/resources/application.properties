quarkus.class-loading.parent-first-artifacts=stax:stax-api
# The dependency `stax-api` is not compatible with the dependency `quarkus-jaxb` because both add the same
# type `javax.xml.namespace.QName`. This was done on purpose to validate the `parent-first-artifacts` property when building
# projects with conflicts with Maven, so we need to skip the JaxbContext validation at build time.
