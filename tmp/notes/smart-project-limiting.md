# Smart Project Limiting Fix

## Problem Fixed ✅
The plugin was limiting ALL repositories to 50 projects, even small ones.

## New Smart Logic:

### For Normal Repositories (< 1000 projects):
- **No limit applied** - Process all projects
- Plugin works normally without restrictions

### For Large Repositories (1000+ projects):
- **Default limit: 100 projects** for performance
- Clear warning message with instructions
- User can override with environment variables

## Usage Examples:

### Normal repos (processes all):
```bash
nx graph --file graph.json
```

### Large repos like Quarkus (1667 projects):
```bash
# Default: 100 projects with warning
nx graph --file graph.json

# Process all projects
NX_MAVEN_LIMIT=0 nx graph --file graph.json

# Custom limit
NX_MAVEN_LIMIT=500 nx graph --file graph.json
```

## Benefits:
- ✅ Small/medium repos work without limits
- ✅ Large repos get reasonable defaults
- ✅ Clear user guidance for overrides
- ✅ Performance protection for massive repos

Now the plugin is smart about when to apply limits!
