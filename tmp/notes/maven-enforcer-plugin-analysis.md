# Maven Enforcer Plugin Issue Analysis

## Problem Identified

The maven-enforcer-plugin is being invoked without proper configuration when the Nx Maven plugin runs `ExecutionPlanAnalysisService.calculateExecutionPlan()`.

## Root Cause

1. **Location of Issue**: `/home/jason/projects/triage/java/quarkus/maven-plugin/src/main/java/ExecutionPlanAnalysisService.java`, line 134
   ```java
   MavenExecutionPlan executionPlan = lifecycleExecutor.calculateExecutionPlan(session, phase);
   ```

2. **Problem**: The maven-plugin project (`/home/jason/projects/triage/java/quarkus/maven-plugin/pom.xml`) is standalone and does not inherit from the Quarkus parent POM structure.

3. **Missing Configuration**: 
   - The main Quarkus project defines `maven-enforcer-plugin.phase=validate` (line 63 in `/home/jason/projects/triage/java/quarkus/pom.xml`)
   - The parent POM uses this property: `<phase>${maven-enforcer-plugin.phase}</phase>` (line 134 in `/home/jason/projects/triage/java/quarkus/independent-projects/parent/pom.xml`)
   - But the maven-plugin POM doesn't inherit these properties, so `${maven-enforcer-plugin.phase}` resolves to an empty/null value

4. **When Error Occurs**: When `calculateExecutionPlan()` is called for the "validate" phase, it attempts to execute the maven-enforcer-plugin with an undefined phase configuration.

## Files Affected

1. **Main Issue**: `/home/jason/projects/triage/java/quarkus/maven-plugin/src/main/java/ExecutionPlanAnalysisService.java:134`
2. **Configuration**: `/home/jason/projects/triage/java/quarkus/maven-plugin/pom.xml` (missing parent inheritance)
3. **Expected Config**: `/home/jason/projects/triage/java/quarkus/independent-projects/parent/pom.xml:134` (enforcer plugin phase config)

## Solution Applied

**FIXED**: Added property definition directly to maven-plugin/pom.xml

Added to `/home/jason/projects/triage/java/quarkus/maven-plugin/pom.xml`:
```xml
<maven-enforcer-plugin.phase>validate</maven-enforcer-plugin.phase>
```

## Verification

1. ✅ Maven plugin compiles successfully
2. ✅ Nx analyzer runs without enforcer errors (`mvn io.quarkus:maven-plugin:999-SNAPSHOT:analyze`)
3. ✅ Works both with enforcer enabled and disabled
4. ✅ No more undefined `${maven-enforcer-plugin.phase}` property

The issue has been resolved. The Nx integration now properly handles Maven's execution model without triggering enforcer plugin configuration errors.
