## Reporting an issue

This project uses GitHub issues to manage the issues. Open an issue directly in GitHub.

If you believe you found a bug, and it's likely possible, please indicate a way to reproduce it, what you are seeing and what you would expect to see.
Don't forget to indicate your Quarkus, Java, Maven/Gradle and GraalVM version. 

## Checking an issue is fixed in main

Sometimes a bug has been fixed in the `main` branch of Quarkus and you want to confirm it is fixed for your own application.
Testing the `main` branch is easy and you have two options:

* either use the snapshots we publish daily on https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/
* or build Quarkus all by yourself

This is a quick summary to get you to quickly test main.
If you are interested in having more details, refer to the [Build section](#build) and the [Usage section](#usage).

### Using snapshots

Snapshots are published daily so you will have to wait for a snapshot containing the commits you are interested in.

Then just add https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ as a Maven repository **and** a plugin repository.

You can check the last publication date here: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/quarkus/ .

### Building main

Just do the following:

```
git clone git@github.com:quarkusio/quarkus.git
cd quarkus
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx4g"
./mvnw -Dquickly
```

Wait for a bit and you're done.

### Updating the version

Be careful, when using the `main` branch, you need to use the `quarkus-bom` instead of the `quarkus-universe-bom`.

Update both the versions of the `quarkus-bom` and the Quarkus Maven plugin to `999-SNAPSHOT`.

You can now test your application.

## Before you contribute

To contribute, use GitHub Pull Requests, from your **own** fork.

Also, make sure you have set up your Git authorship correctly:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

If you use different computers to contribute, please make sure the name is the same on all your computers.

We use this information to acknowledge your contributions in release announcements.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, need to be reviewed before being merged.

### Coding Guidelines

 * We decided to disallow `@author` tags in the Javadoc: they are hard to maintain, especially in a very active project, and we use the Git history to track authorship. GitHub also has [this nice page with your contributions](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/graphs/contributors). For each major Quarkus release, we also publish the list of contributors in the announcement post.
 * Commits should be atomic and semantic. Please properly squash your pull requests before submitting them. Fixup commits can be used temporarily during the review process but things should be squashed at the end to have meaningful commits.
 We use merge commits so the GitHub Merge button cannot do that for us. If you don't know how to do that, just ask in your pull request, we will be happy to help!

### Continuous Integration

Because we are all humans, and to ensure Quarkus is stable for everyone, all changes must go through Quarkus continuous integration. Quarkus CI is based on GitHub Actions, which means that everyone has the ability to automatically execute CI in their forks as part of the process of making changes. We ask that all non-trivial changes go through this process, so that the contributor gets immediate feedback, while at the same time keeping our CI fast and healthy for everyone.

The process requires only one additional step to enable Actions on your fork (clicking the green button in the actions tab). [See the full video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/egqbx-Q-Cbg) for more details on how to do this.

To keep the caching of non-Quarkus artifacts efficient (speeding up CI), you should occasionally sync the `main` branch of your fork with `main` of this repo (e.g. monthly).

### Tests and documentation are not optional

Don't forget to include tests in your pull requests. 
Also don't forget the documentation (reference documentation, javadoc...).

Be sure to test your pull request in:

1. Java mode
2. Native mode

## Setup

If you have not done so on this machine, you need to:
 
* Install Git and configure your GitHub access
* Install Java SDK 8 or 11+ (OpenJDK recommended)
* Install [GraalVM](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image)
* Install platform C developer tools:
    * Linux
        * Make sure headers are available on your system (you'll hit 'Basic header file missing (<zlib.h>)' error if they aren't).
            * On Fedora `sudo dnf install zlib-devel`
            * Otherwise `sudo apt-get install libz-dev`
    * macOS
        * `xcode-select --install` 
* Set `GRAALVM_HOME` to your GraalVM Home directory e.g. `/opt/graalvm` on Linux or `$location/JDK/GraalVM/Contents/Home` on macOS

Docker is not strictly necessary: it is used to run the MariaDB and PostgreSQL tests which are not enabled by default. However it is a recommended install if you plan to work on Quarkus JPA support:

* Check [the installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and [the MacOS installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* If you just install docker, be sure that your current user can run a container (no root required). 
On Linux, check [the post-installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)

### IDE Config and Code Style

Quarkus has a strictly enforced code style. Code formatting is done by the Eclipse code formatter, using the config files
found in the `independent-projects/ide-config` directory. By default when you run `./mvnw install` the code will be formatted automatically.
When submitting a pull request the CI build will fail if running the formatter results in any code changes, so it is
recommended that you always run a full Maven build before submitting a pull request.

If you want to run the formatting without doing a full build, you can run `./mvnw process-sources`.

#### Eclipse Setup

Open the *Preferences* window, and then navigate to _Java_ -> _Code Style_ -> _Formatter_. Click _Import_ and then
select the `eclipse-format.xml` file in the `independent-projects/ide-config` directory.

Next navigate to _Java_ -> _Code Style_ -> _Organize Imports_. Click _Import_ and select the `eclipse.importorder` file.

#### IDEA Setup

##### How to work

Quarkus is a large project and IDEA will have a hard time compiling the whole of it.
Before you start coding, make sure to build the project using Maven from the commandline
with `./mvnw -Dquickly`.

##### `OutOfMemoryError` while importing

After creating an IDEA project, the first import might fail with an `OutOfMemory` error,
as the size of the project requires more memory than the IDEA default settings allow.

**Note** In some IDEA versions the `OutOfMemory` error goes unreported. 
So if no error is reported but IDEA is still failing to find symbols or the dependencies are wrong in the imported project, then importing might have failed due to an unreported `OutOfMemory` exception.
One can further investigate this by inspecting the `org.jetbrains.idea.maven.server.RemoteMavenServer36` process (or processes) using `JConsole`.

To fix that, open the _Preferences_ window (or _Settings_ depending on your edition),
then navigate to _Build, Execution, Deployment_ > _Build Tools_ > _Maven_ > _Importing_.
In _VM options for importer_, raise the heap to at least 2 GB; some people reported
needing more, e.g. `-Xmx8g`.

In recent IDEA versions (e.g. 2020.3) this might not work because _VM options for importer_ get ignored when `.mvn/jdk.config` is present (see [IDEA-250160](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-250160))
it disregards the _VM options for importer_ settings.
An alternative solution is to go to _Help_ > _Edit Custom Properties..._ and
add the following line:

`idea.maven.embedder.xmx=8g`

After these configurations, you might need to run  _File_ -> _Invalidate Caches and Restart_ 
and then trigger a `Reload all Maven projects`.

##### `package sun.misc does not exist` while building

You may get an error like this during the build:

```
Error:(46, 56) java: package sun.misc does not exist
```

To fix this go to _Settings_ > _Build, Execution, Deployment_ > _Compiler_ > _Java Compiler_
and disable _Use '--release' option for cross compilation (java 9 and later)_.

##### Formatting

Open the _Preferences_ window (or _Settings_ depending on your edition), navigate to _Plugins_ and install the [Eclipse Code Formatter Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546-eclipse-code-formatter) from the Marketplace.

Restart your IDE, open the *Preferences* (or *Settings*) window again and navigate to _Other Settings_ -> _Eclipse Code Formatter_.

Select _Use the Eclipse Code Formatter_, then change the _Eclipse Java Formatter Config File_ to point to the
`eclipse-format.xml` file in the `independent-projects/ide-config` directory. Make sure the _Optimize Imports_ box is ticked, and
select the `eclipse.importorder` file as the import order config file.

Next, disable wildcard imports:
navigate to _Editor_ -> _Code Style_ -> _Java_ -> _Imports_
and set _Class count to use import with '\*'_ to `999`.
Do the same with _Names count to use static import with '\*'_.

## Build

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus.git`
* Navigate to the directory: `cd quarkus`
* Set Maven heap to 4GB `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx4g"`
* Invoke `./mvnw -Dquickly` from the root directory
* _Note: On Windows, it may be necessary to run the build from an elevated shell. If you experience a failed build with the error `"A required privilege is not held by the client"`, this should fix it._

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus.git
cd quarkus
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx4g"
./mvnw -Dquickly
# Wait... success!
```

This build skipped all the tests, native-image builds, documentation generation etc. and used the Maven goals `clean install` by default.
For more details about `-Dquickly` have a look at the `quick-build` profile in `quarkus-parent` (root `pom.xml`).

Adding `-DskipTests=false -DskipITs=false` enables the tests.
It will take much longer to build but will give you more guarantees on your code.

You can build and test native images in the integration tests supporting it by using `./mvnw install -Dnative`.

### Workflow tips

Due to Quarkus being a large repository, having to rebuild the entire project every time a change is made isn't very productive. 
The following Maven tips can vastly speed up development when working on a specific extension.

#### Building all modules of an extension

Let's say you want to make changes to the `Jackson` extension. This extension contains the `deployment`, `runtime` and `spi` modules
which can all be built by executing following command:

```
./mvnw install -f extensions/jackson/
```

This command uses the path of the extension on the filesystem to identify it. Moreover, Maven will automatically build all modules in that path recursively.

#### Building a single module of an extension

Let's say you want to make changes to the `deployment` module of the Jackson extension. There are two ways to accomplish this task as shown by the following commands:

```
./mvnw install -f extensions/jackson/deployment
```

or 

```
./mvnw install --projects 'io.quarkus:quarkus-jackson-deployment'
```

In this command we use the groupId and artifactId of the module to identify it.

#### Running a single test

Often you need to run a single test from some Maven module. Say for example you want to run the `GreetingResourceTest` of the `resteasy-jackson` Quarkus integration test (which can be found [here](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/integration-tests/resteasy-jackson)).
One way to accomplish this is by executing the following command:

```
./mvnw test -f integration-tests/resteasy-jackson/ -Dtest=GreetingResourceTest
```

#### Automatic incremental build

:information_source: This feature is currently in testing mode. You're invited to give it a go and please reach out via [Zulip](https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187038-dev) or GitHub in case something doesn't work as expected or you have ideas to improve things.

Instead of _manually_ specifying the modules to build as in the previous examples, you can tell [gitflow-incremental-builder (GIB)](https://github.com/gitflow-incremental-builder/gitflow-incremental-builder) to only build the modules that have been changed or depend on modules that have been changed (downstream).
E.g.:
```
./mvnw install -Dincremental
```
This will build all modules (and their downstream modules) that have been changed compared to your _local_ `main`, including untracked and uncommitted changes.

If you just want to build the changes since the last commit on the current branch, you can switch off the branch comparison via `-Dgib.disableBranchComparison` (or short: `-Dgib.dbc`).

There are many more configuration options in GIB you can use to customize its behaviour: https://github.com/gitflow-incremental-builder/gitflow-incremental-builder#configuration

Parallel builds (`-T...`) should work without problems but parallel test execution is not yet supported (in general, not a GIB limitation).

##### Special case `bom-descriptor-json`

Without going too much into details (`devtools/bom-descriptor-json/pom.xml` has more info), you should build this module _without_ `-Dincremental` _if you changed any extension "metadata"_:

* Addition/renaming/removal of an extension
* Any other changes to any `quarkus-extension.yaml`

##### Usage by CI

The GitHub Actions based Quarkus CI is using GIB to reduce the average build time of pull request builds and builds of branches in your fork.

CI is using a slighty different GIB config than locally:

* [Special handling of "Explicitly selected projects"](https://github.com/gitflow-incremental-builder/gitflow-incremental-builder#explicitly-selected-projects) is deactivated
* Untracked/uncommitted changes are not considered
* Branch comparison is more complex due to distributed GitHub forks
* Certain "critical" branches like `main` are not built incrementally

For more details see the `Get GIB arguments` step in `.github/workflows/ci-actions-incremental.yml`.

## Usage

After the build was successful, the artifacts are available in your local Maven repository.

To include them into your project a few things have to be changed.

#### With Maven

*pom.xml*

```
<properties>
    <quarkus-plugin.version>999-SNAPSHOT</quarkus-plugin.version>
    <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>
    <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus</quarkus.platform.group-id>
    <quarkus.platform.version>999-SNAPSHOT</quarkus.platform.version>
    .
    .
    .
</properties>
```

#### With Gradle

*gradle.properties*

```
quarkusPlatformArtifactId=quarkus-bom
quarkusPluginVersion=999-SNAPSHOT
quarkusPlatformVersion=999-SNAPSHOT
quarkusPlatformGroupId=io.quarkus
```

*settings.gradle*

```
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal() // add mavenLocal() to first position
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
    .
    .
    .
}
```
 
*build.gradle*

```
repositories {
    mavenLocal() // add mavenLocal() to first position
    mavenCentral()
}
```

### MicroProfile TCK's

Quarkus has a TCK module in `tcks` where all the MicroProfile TCK's are set up for you to run if you wish. These 
include tests to areas like Config, JWT Authentication, Fault Tolerance, Health Checks, Metrics, OpenAPI, OpenTracing, 
REST Client, Reactive Messaging and Context Propagation.

The TCK module is not part of the main Maven reactor build, but you can enable it and run the TCK tests by activating 
the Maven Profile `-Ptcks`. If your work is related to any of these areas, running the TCK's is highly recommended to 
make sure you are not breaking the project. The TCK's will also run on any Pull Request.

You can either run all of the TCK's or just a subset by executing `mvn verify` in the `tcks` module root or each of 
the submodules. If you wish to run a particular test, you can use Maven `-Dtest=` property with the fully qualified 
name of the test class and optionally the method name by using 
`mvn verify -Dtest=fully.qualified.test.class.name#methodName`.

### Test Coverage

Quarkus uses Jacoco to generate test coverage. If you would like to generate the report run `mvn install -Ptest-coverage`,
then change into the `coverage-report` directory and run `mvn package`. The code coverage report will be generated in
`target/site/jacoco/`.

This currently does not work on Windows as it uses a shell script to copy all the classes and files into the code coverage
module.

If you just need a report for a single module, run `mvn install jacoco:report -Ptest-coverage` in that module (or with `-f ...`).

## Extensions

### Descriptions

Extensions descriptions (in the `runtime/pom.xml` description or in the YAML `quarkus-extension.yaml`)
are used to describe the extension and are visible in https://code.quarkus.io.
Try and pay attention to it.
Here are a few recommendation guidelines:

- keep it relatively short so that no hover is required to read it
- describe the function over the technology
- use an action / verb to start the sentence
- do no conjugate the action verb (`Connect foo`, not `Connects foo` nor `Connecting foo`)
- connectors (JDBC / reactive) etc tend to start with Connect
- do not mention `Quarkus`
- do not mention `extension`
- avoid repeating the extension name

Bad examples and the corresponding good example:

- "AWS Lambda" (use "Write AWS Lambda functions")
- "Extension for building container images with Docker" (use "Build container images with Docker")
- "PostgreSQL database connector" (use "Connect to the PostgreSQL database via JDBC")
- "Asynchronous messaging for Reactive Streams" (use "Produce and consume messages and implement event driven and data streaming applications")

### Update dependencies to extensions

When adding a new extension you should run `update-extension-dependencies.sh` so that special modules like `devtools/bom-descriptor-json`
that are consuming this extension are built *after* the respective extension. Simply add to your commit the files that were changed by the script.

When removing an extension make sure to also remove all dependencies to it from all `pom.xml`.
It's easy to miss this as long as the extension artifact is still present in your local Maven repository.

## The small print

This project is an open source project, please act responsibly, be nice, polite and enjoy!

## Frequently Asked Questions

* The Maven build fails with `OutOfMemoryException`

  Set Maven options to use more memory: `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx4g"`.

* IntelliJ fails to import Quarkus Maven project with `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded` 

  In IntelliJ IDEA if you see problems in the Maven view claiming `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded` that means the project import failed.

  See section `IDEA Setup` as there are different possible solutions described.

* IntelliJ does not recognize the project as a Java 11 project

  In the Maven pane, uncheck the `include-jdk-misc` and `compile-java8-release-flag` profiles

* Build hangs with DevMojoIT running infinitely
  ```
  ./mvnw clean install
  # Wait...
  [INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.192 s - in io.quarkus.maven.it.GenerateConfigIT
  [INFO] Running io.quarkus.maven.it.DevMojoIT
  ```
  DevMojoIT require a few minutes to run but anything more than that is not expected. Make sure that nothing is running on 8080.

* The native integration test for my extension didn't run in the CI

  In the interest of speeding up CI, the native build job `native-tests` have been split into multiple categories which are run in parallel.
  This means that each new extension needs to be configured explicitly in [`native-tests.json`](.github/native-tests.json) to have its integration tests run in native mode.

* Build aborts complaining about missing (or superfluous) `minimal *-deployment dependencies` or `illegal runtime dependencies`

  To ensure a consistent build order, even when building in parallel (`./mvnw -T...`) or building incrementally/partially (`./mvnw -pl...`), the build enforces the presence of certain dependencies.
  If those dependencies are not present, your local build will most likely use possibly outdated artifacts from you local repo and CI build might even fail not finding certain artifacts.

  Just do what the failing enforcer rule is telling you and you should be fine.

* Build fails with multiple `This project has been banned from the build due to previous failures` messages

  Just scroll up, there should be an error or warning somewhere. Failing enforcer rules are known to cause such effects and in this case there'll be something like:
  ```
  [WARNING] Rule 0: ... failed with message:
  ...
  ```
