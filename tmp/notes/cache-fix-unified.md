# Fixed Cache Unification - Complete Analysis Storage

## Issue Fixed
The cache was only storing either nodes OR dependencies, not both together. This meant Maven analysis was running multiple times unnecessarily.

## Solution Applied
Now both `createNodesV2` and `createDependencies` functions:
1. Run Maven analysis once
2. Extract both `createNodesResults` and `createDependencies` from the analysis 
3. Store both results in the cache simultaneously
4. Return the appropriate data for each function

## Key Changes
- Both functions now cache the complete analysis results
- Single Maven analysis run provides data for both functions
- Cache structure stores both nodes and dependencies together
- Eliminates redundant Maven analysis calls

## Benefits
- Faster execution (no duplicate Maven analysis)
- Consistent cache behavior
- Single source of truth for analysis data
