= Quarkus Extension Metadata
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: writing-extensions
:topics: extensions,codestarts

Quarkus extensions are distributed as Maven JAR artifacts that application and other libraries may depend on. When a Quarkus application project is built, tested or edited using the Quarkus dev tools, Quarkus extension JAR artifacts will be identified on the application classpath by the presence of the Quarkus extension metadata files in them.
This document describes the purpose of each Quarkus extension metadata file and its content.

IMPORTANT: Two of the metadata files have the same name but different extensions, `quarkus-extension.yaml` and `quarkus-extension.properties`. It is easy to mix them up, be careful. You will usually edit the YAML file and track it in your SCM. While you _can_ manually manage the properties file, Quarkus will generate it at build if you don't.

[[quarkus-extension-yaml]]
== META-INF/quarkus-extension.yaml

Every **runtime** extension artifact **must** include this file. This file is used by Quarkus dev tools when displaying information about an extension, creating a new project or adding extensions to an existing project, etc. This file isn't used at application build or bootstrap times.
The basic and required metadata included in this file can be generated by the Quarkus Maven and Gradle plugins when the extension artifact is built. However, typically, extension authors will want to provide more information about the extension to the Quarkus dev tools and users. The extra information could be provided
in a template `META-INF/quarkus-extension.yaml` found in the extension runtime module's resources directory, e.g. `src/main/resources/META-INF/quarkus-extension.yaml`. Here is an example of such a template for the `quarkus-resteasy-reactive` extension:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
name: "REST" <1>
artifact: ${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version} <2>

<3> Short name that could be used to quickly locate an extension in the catalog of extensions provided by the dev tools to the users
<4> Keywords that can be used to search for extensions in the extension catalog provided by the dev tools to the users
<5> Categories the extension should appear under on https://code.quarkus.io[code.quarkus.io]. This field can be omitted, the extension will still be listed on https://code.quarkus.io[code.quarkus.io] but won't be categorized
<6> Maturity status that could be `stable`, `preview`, `experimental`. It is up to extension maintainers to evaluate the maturity status and communicate it to the users
<7> Link to the extension guide or documentation page
<8> Link to an externally hosted image. This is used in the Quarkus dev tools as the extension icon. It should be square, and any resolution greater than 220 pixels. Supported formats are png, jpeg, tiff, webp, and svg. Alternatively, if you https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview[set the social media preview] on the extension's source code repository, the tools will pick up that image.

[[quarkus-extension-properties]]
== META-INF/quarkus-extension.properties

Every **runtime** extension artifact **must** include this file. This file is read by the Quarkus bootstrap mechanism and is meant to contain only the information that is relevant for **building or bootstrapping** an applications. This file is typically generated by the corresponding Quarkus Maven or Gradle plugin when the extension project is built and shouldn't be edited manually.
The following properties may appear in this file:

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Presence
| Description

| `deployment-artifact`
| Required
| Points to the corresponding extension deployment artifact in the `groupId:artifactId[:classifier:type]:version` format

| `parent-first-artifacts`
| Optional
| Comma-separated list of artifact keys (`groupId:artifactId:classifier:type`) that are to be loaded in a parent first manner. This can be used to work around issues where a given class needs to be loaded by the system ClassLoader.

| `runner-parent-first-artifacts`
| Optional
| Comma-separated list of artifact keys that are to be loaded in a parent first manner in addition to those configured with `parent-first-artifacts` when an application is launched from a production binary package. This can be used to work around issues where a given class needs to be loaded by the system ClassLoader.

| `excluded-artifacts`
| Optional
| Comma-separated list of artifact keys that will never be loaded by the class loader, and will not be packed into the final application.

| `lesser-priority-artifacts`
| Optional
| Comma-separated list of artifact keys that will only be used to load a class or resource if no other artifact containing that class or resource exists. This is used in order to control the order of artifacts when multiple contain the same classes.

| `removed-resources.*`
| Optional
| Resources that should be removed/hidden from dependencies. This allows for classes and other resources to be removed from dependencies, so they are not accessible to the application. This is a map of artifact key to a comma-separated list of resources to be removed. When running in dev and test mode these resources are hidden from the ClassLoader, when running in production mode these files are removed from the jars that contain them. Note that if you want to remove a class you need to specify the class file name. e.g. to remove com.acme.Foo you would specify com/acme/Foo.class.

| `provides-capabilities`
| Optional
| List of https://quarkus.io/guides/capabilities[capabilities] this extension provides

| `requires-capabilities`
| Optional
| List of https://quarkus.io/guides/capabilities[capabilities] this extension requires to be provided by other Quarkus extensions

| `conditional-dependencies`
| Optional
| List of https://quarkus.io/guides/conditional-extension-dependencies[conditional dependencies] this extension declares

| `dependency-condition`
| Optional
| https://quarkus.io/guides/conditional-extension-dependencies[Dependency condition] that has to be satisfied for a conditional dependency on this extension to be activated

| `dev-mode.jvm-option.std.<option-name>=<option-value>`
| Optional
| Standard Java command line option that should be added to command line launching an application in dev mode

| `dev-mode.jvm-option.xx.<option-name>=<option-value>`
| Optional
| `-XX:` Java command line option that should be added to command line launching an application in dev mode

| `dev-mode.lock.jvm-options`
| Optional
| A comma-separated list of standard Java command line options that should not be overridden by values that are pre-configured by the Quarkus Maven and Gradle plugins by default

| `dev-mode.lock.xx-jvm-options`
| Optional
| A comma-separated list of `-XX:` Java command line options that should not be overridden by values that are pre-configured by the Quarkus Maven and Gradle plugins by default

|===

[[quarkus-config-roots]]
== META-INF/quarkus-config-roots.list

This file may appear in a runtime extension artifact as well as in a deployment one. This file must not be edited manually, it is generated as part of the extension project build process and contains a list of Java class names that are annotated with `io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.ConfigRoot` an extension provides.

[[quarkus-javadoc-properties]]
== META-INF/quarkus-javadoc.properties

Same as `quarkus-config-roots.list`, this file may appear in a runtime extension artifact as well in a deployment one. It is generated as part of the extension project build process from the descriptions of configuration options available in the classes annotated with `io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.ConfigRoot` and is not supported to be edited manually.

[[quarkus-build-steps]]
== META-INF/quarkus-build-steps.list

This file may appear in a deployment extension artifact. It contains a list of classes that implement Quarkus build steps (methods annotated with `io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.BuildStep`). This file is generated as part of the extension project build process and must not be edited manually.

[[quarkus-extension-maven-plugin]]
== Quarkus Extension Maven Plugin

The `quarkus-extension-maven-plugin` is configured in the runtime module of a Quarkus extension Maven project and serves the following purposes:

* validate extension metadata configuration;
* generate extension metadata;
* check whether extension dependencies conform to the Quarkus extension dependency model.

=== Dev mode JVM options

An extension may pre-configure certain Java command line options that should be added to the command line
launching an application in Dev mode. Here is how such options can be configured in the `quarkus-extension-maven-plugin` configuration:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
            <plugin>
                <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
                <artifactId>quarkus-extension-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${quarkus.version}</version>

                            <goal>extension-descriptor</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <devMode>
                                <jvmOptions>
                                    <add-modules>jdk.incubator.vector</add-modules>
                                    <enable-preview/>
                                    <enable-native-access>ALL-UNNAMED</enable-native-access>
                                </jvmOptions>
                                <xxJvmOptions>
                                    <UseThreadPriorities>false</UseThreadPriorities>
                                </xxJvmOptions>
                                <lockJvmOptions>agentlib:jdwp</lockJvmOptions>
                                <lockXxJvmOptions>TieredStopAtLevel</lockXxJvmOptions>
                            </devMode>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
----

The `extension-descriptor` goal will generate `META-INF/quarkus-extension.properties` with the corresponding properties.
And once an application that has a dependency on this extension is launched in Dev mode, the logs will look like
[source,bash]
----

----

Note, there are a couple `INFO` messages informing the user that the values for certain options Quarkus uses
by default in Dev mode were overridden by the extension preferences. Specifically, the C2 compiler was re-enabled
and the debug mode was disabled. A user can still choose to enable the debug agent and disable the C2 compilter
if necessary by explicitly setting the corresponding Quarkus Maven or Gradle plugin parameter values.
