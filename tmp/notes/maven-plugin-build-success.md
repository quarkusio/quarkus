# Maven Plugin Build Success

## Problem Solved
✅ The batch executor implementation works correctly when goals are run together in a single Maven session.

## Test Results

### ✅ Individual JAR Goal
```bash
nx maven-jar:jar maven-plugin
# SUCCESS: Creates target/maven-plugin-999-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### ✅ Batch JAR + Install
```bash
cd maven-plugin
java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* NxMavenBatchExecutor "org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-jar-plugin:jar,org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:install" "." false
# SUCCESS: JAR created AND installed to ~/.m2/repository
```

### ❌ Separate Install Goal  
```bash
nx maven-install:install maven-plugin
# FAILS: "The packaging plugin did not assign a file to the build artifact"
```

## Root Cause
The `maven-install:install` goal requires the JAR artifact to be set in the Maven project context, which only happens when the `maven-jar:jar` goal runs in the same session.

## Current Issue: Dependency Calculation
The Nx target generation is creating individual goal targets but missing the critical dependency:
- `maven-install:install` should depend on `maven-jar:jar` (same project)
- Currently it only depends on `^install` (upstream projects)

## Solution Working
The batch executor correctly preserves Maven session context, allowing:
1. `maven-jar:jar` to create the JAR and set `project.getArtifact().setFile()`
2. `maven-install:install` to access that artifact in the same session

## Next Steps
Need to fix the dependency calculation in `TargetDependencyService` to ensure proper intra-project goal dependencies based on Maven lifecycle ordering.

## Maven Plugin Status
✅ **Plugin compilation**: Working
✅ **Batch executor**: Working 
✅ **Session context preservation**: Working
✅ **JAR + Install in same session**: Working
❌ **Individual goal dependencies**: Needs fixing
