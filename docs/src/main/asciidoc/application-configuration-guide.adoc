= Quarkus - Configuring Your Application

include::./attributes.adoc[]

Hardcoded values in your code is a _no go_ (even if we all did it at some point ;-)).
In this guide, we learn how to configure your application.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* between 5 and 10 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `application-configuration` directory.

== Creating the Maven project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=application-configuration \
    -DclassName="org.acme.config.GreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/greeting"
----

It generates:

* the Maven structure
* a landing page accessible on `http://localhost:8080`
* example `Dockerfile` files for both `native` and `jvm` modes
* the application configuration file
* an `org.acme.config.GreetingResource` resource
* an associated test

== Injecting configuration value

Quarkus uses https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config] to inject the configuration in the application.
The injection uses the `@ConfigProperty` annotation.

[source,java]
----
@ConfigProperty(name = "greeting.message")
String message;
----

NOTE: When injecting a configured value, you can use `@Inject @ConfigProperty` or just `@ConfigProperty`.
The `@Inject` annotation is not necessary for members annotated with `@ConfigProperty`, a behavior which differs from https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config[MicroProfile Config]

Edit the `org.acme.config.GreetingResource`, and introduce the following configuration properties:

[source,java]
----
@ConfigProperty(name = "greeting.message") <1>
String message;

@ConfigProperty(name = "greeting.suffix", defaultValue="!") <2>
String suffix;

@ConfigProperty(name = "greeting.name") 
Optional<String> name; <3>
----
<1> If you do not provide a value for this property, the application startup fails with `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.DeploymentException: No config value of type [class java.lang.String] exists for: greeting.message`.
<2> The default value is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.suffix`.
<3> This property is optional - an empty `Optional` is injected if the configuration does not provide a value for `greeting.name`.

Now, modify the `hello` method to use the injected properties:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String hello() {
    return message + " " + name.orElse("world") + suffix;
}
----


== Create the configuration

By default, Quarkus reads `application.properties`.
Edit the `src/main/resources/application.properties` with the following content:

[source,shell]
----
# Your configuration properties
greeting.message = hello
greeting.name = quarkus
----

Once set, check the application with:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/greeting
hello quarkus!
----

TIP: If the application requires configuration values and these values are not set, an error is thrown.
So you can quickly know when your configuration is complete.

== Update the test

We also need to update the functional test to reflect the changes made to endpoint.
Edit the `src/test/java/org/acme/config/GreetingResourceTest.java` file and change the content of the `testHelloEndpoint` method to:


[source,java]
----
package org.acme.config;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;

@QuarkusTest
public class GreetingResourceTest {

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
          .when().get("/greeting")
          .then()
             .statusCode(200)
             .body(is("hello quarkus!")); // Modified line
    }

}
----

== Package and run the application

Run the application with: `./mvnw compile quarkus:dev`.
Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/greeting.

Changing the configuration file is immediately reflected.
You can add the `greeting.suffix`, remove the other properties, change the values, etc.

As usual, the application can be packaged using `./mvnw clean package` and executed using the `-runner.jar` file.
You can also generate the native executable with `./mvnw clean package -Pnative`.

== Configuring Quarkus

Quarkus itself is configured via the same mechanism as your application. Quarkus reserves the `quarkus.` namespace
for its own configuration. For example to configure the HTTP server port you can set `quarkus.http.port` in
`application.properties`.

It is also possible to generate an example `application.properties` with all known configuration properties, to make
it easy to see what Quarkus configuration options are available. To do this run

[source,shell]
--
./mvnw quarkus:generate-config
--

This will create a `src/main/resources/application.properties.example` file that contains all the config options
exposed via the extensions you currently have installed. These options are commented out, and have their default value
when applicable. For example this HTTP port config entry will appear as:


[source,properties]
--
#
# The HTTP port
#
#quarkus.http.port=8080
--

Rather than generating an example config file you can also add these to you actual config file by setting the `-Dfile`
parameter:

[source,shell]
--
./mvnw quarkus:generate-config -Dfile=application.properties
--

If a config option is already present (commented or uncommented) it will not be added, so it is safe to run this after
adding an additional extension to see what additional options have been added.

== Overriding properties at runtime

Quarkus does much of its configuration and bootstrap at build time.
Most properties will then be read and set during the build time step.
To change them, make sure to repackage your application.

[source,shell]
--
./mvnw clean package
--

Extensions do define _some_ properties as overridable at runtime.
A canonical example is the database URL, username and password which is only known specifically in your target environment.
This is a tradeoff as the more runtime properties are available, the less build time prework Quarkus can do. The list of runtime properties is therefore lean.

You can override these runtime properties with the following mechanisms (in decreasing priority):

1. using system properties:
  * for a runner jar: `java -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`
  * for a native executable: `./target/myapp-runner -Dquarkus.datasource.password=youshallnotpass`
2. using environment variables:
  * for a runner jar: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; java -jar target/myapp-runner.jar`
  * for a native executable: `export QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=youshallnotpass ; ./target/myapp-runner`

NOTE: Environment variables names are following the conversion rules of link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configsources[Eclipse MicroProfile]

=== Configuration Profiles

Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles. These allow you to have multiple configuration in the same file and
select between then via a profile name.

The syntax for this is `%{profile}.config.key=value`. For example if I have the following:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.port=9090
%dev.quarkus.http.port=8181
----

The Quarkus HTTP port will be 9090, unless the 'dev' profile is active, in which case it will be 8181.

By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. The default profiles are:

* *dev* - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)
* *test* - Activated when running tests
* *prod* - The default profile when not running in development or test mode

There are two ways to set a custom profile, either via the `quarkus.profile` system property or the `QUARKUS_PROFILE`
environment variable. If both are set the environment variable takes precedence. Note that it is not necessary to
define the names of these profiles anywhere, all that is necessary is to create a config property with the profile
name, and then set the current profile to that name. For example if I want a 'staging' profile with a different HTTP port
I can add the following to `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.port=9090
%staging.quarkus.http.port=9999
----

And then set the `QUARKUS_PROFILE` environment variable to 'staging' to activate my profile.

== Custom Configuration

=== Custom configuration sources

You can also introduce custom configuration sources in the standard MicroProfile Config manner.  To
do this, you must provide a class which implements either `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource`
or `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSourceProvider`.  Create a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[service file] for the
class and it will be detected and installed at application startup.

=== Custom configuration converters

You can also use your custom types as a configuration values. This can be done by implementing `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter<T>`
and adding its fully qualified class name in file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.

Let us assume you have a custom type like this one:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.config;

public class MicroProfileCustomValue {

    private final int number;

    public MicroProfileCustomValue(int number) {
        this.number = number;
    };

    public int getNumber() {
        return number;
    }
}
----

The corresponding converter will look like the one below. Please note that your custom converter class must be `public` and must have
a `public` no-argument constructor. It also must not be `abstract`.


[source,java]
----
package org.acme.config;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;

public class MicroProfileCustomValueConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {

    @Override
    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {
        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(Integer.valueOf(value));
    }
}
----

Then you need to include fully qualified class name of converter in a service file `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.
If you have more converters simply add their class names in this file as well. Single fully qualified class name per line, for example:

[source]
----
org.acme.config.MicroProfileCustomValueConverter
org.acme.config.SomeOtherConverter
org.acme.config.YetAnotherConverter
----

Please note that `SomeOtherConverter` and `YetAnotherConverter` was added just for a demonstration. If you include in this file classes
which are not available in runtime, the converters loading will fail.

After this is done you can use your custom type as a configuration value:

[source,java]
----
@ConfigProperty(name = "configuration.value.name")
MicroProfileCustomValue value;
----

==== Converter priority

In some cases you may want to use a custom converter to convert a type which is already converted
by a different converter. In such cases, you can use the `javax.annotation.Priority` annotation to
change converters precedence and make your custom converter of higher priority than the other
on the list.

By default, if no `@Priority` can be found on a converter, it's registered with a priority of 100
and all Quarkus core converters are registered with a priority of 200, so depending on which
converter you would like to replace, you need to set a higher value.

To demonstrate the idea let us implement a custom converter which will take precedence over 
`MicroProfileCustomValueConverter` implemented in the previous example.

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.config;

import javax.annotation.Priority;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter;

@Priority(150)
public class MyCustomConverter implements Converter<MicroProfileCustomValue> {

    @Override
    public MicroProfileCustomValue convert(String value) {

        final int secretNumber;
        if (value.startsFrom("OBF:")) {
            secretNumber = Integer.valueOf(SecretDecoder.decode(value));
        } else {
            secretNumber = Integer.valueOf(value);
        }

        return new MicroProfileCustomValue(secretNumber);
    }
}
----

Since it converts the same value type (namely `MicroProfileCustomValue`) and has a priority
of 150, it will be used instead of a `MicroProfileCustomValueConverter` which has a default
priority of 100.

NOTE: This new converter also needs to be listed in a service file, i.e. `META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter`.

== More info on how to configure

Quarkus relies on Eclipse MicroProfile and inherit its features.

There are converters that convert your property file content from `String` to typed Java types. See the list link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/converters.asciidoc[in the specification].
