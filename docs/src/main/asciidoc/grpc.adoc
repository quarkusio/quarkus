= Quarkus gRPC

include::./attributes.adoc[]

https://grpc.io/[gRPC] is a high-performance RPC framework.
It can efficiently connect services implemented using various languages and frameworks.
It is also applicable in the last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications, and browsers to backend services.

In general, gRPC uses HTTP/2, TLS, and https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[Protobuf (Protocol Buffers)].
In a microservice architecture, gRPC is an efficient, type-safe alternative to HTTP.

The Quarkus gRPC extension integrate gRPC in Quarkus application.
It:

* supports implementing gRPC services
* supports consuming gRPC services
* integrates with the reactive engine from Quarkus as well as the reactive development model
* allows plain-text communication as well as TLS, and TLS with mutual authentication

Quarkus gRPC is based on https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-grpc/java/[Vert.x gRPC].
