= Packaging And Releasing With JReleaser
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: tooling
:jreleaser-version: 1.6.0
:numbered:
:sectnums:
:sectnumlevels: 4

This guide covers packaging and releasing CLI applications using the link:https://jreleaser.org[JReleaser] tool.

== Prerequisites

include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]
* a GitHub account and a GitHub Personal Access token

== Bootstrapping the project

First, we need a project that defines a CLI application. We recommend using the xref:picocli.adoc[PicoCLI] extension.
This can be done using the following command:

:create-cli-artifact-id: app
:create-cli-code:
include::{includes}/devtools/create-cli.adoc[]

This command initializes the file structure and the minimum set of required files in the project:

[source]
----
.
├── README.md
├── mvnw
├── mvnw.cmd
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── main
        ├── docker
        │   ├── Dockerfile.jvm
        │   ├── Dockerfile.legacy-jar
        │   └── Dockerfile.native
        ├── java
        │   └── org
        │       └── acme
        │           └── GreetingCommand.java
        └── resources
            └── application.properties
----

It will also configure the picocli extension in the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-picocli</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

== Preparing the project for GitHub releases

The project must be hosted at a GitHub repository before we continue. This task can be completed by logging into your
GitHub account, creating a new repository, and adding the newly created sources to said repository. Choose the `main`
branch as default to take advantage of conventions and thus configure less in your `pom.xml`.

You also need a GitHub Personal Access token to be able to post a release to the repository you just created. Follow
the official documentation for
link:https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token[creating a personal access token].
Store the newly created token at a safe place for future reference. Next, you have the choice of configuring the token
as an environment variable named `JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN` so that the tool can read it. Alternatively you may store
the token at a secure location of your choosing, using a `.yml`, `.toml`, `.json`, or `.properties` file. The default
location is `~/.jreleaser/config[format]`. For example, using the `.yml` format this file could look like:

[source,yaml]
.~/.jreleaser/config.yml
----
JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN: <github-token-value>
----

Alright. Add all sources and create a first commit. You can choose your own conventions for commit messages however you
can get more bang for your buck when using JReleaser if you follow the
link:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[Conventional Commits] specification. Make your first commit with the
following message "build: Add initial sources".

== Packaging as a Native Image distribution

Quarkus already knows how to create a native executable using GraalVM Native Image. The default setup will create a
single executable file following a naming convention. However, the JReleaser tool expects a distribution that is, a
conventional file structure packaged as a Zip or Tar file. The file structure must follow this layout:

[source]
----
.
├── LICENSE
├── README
└── bin
    └── executable
----

This structure lets you add all kinds of supporting files required by the executable, such as configuration files,
shell completion scripts, man pages, license, readme, and more.

== Creating the distribution

We can leverage the link:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/[maven-assembly-plugin] to create such
a distribution. We'll also make use of the link:https://github.com/trustin/os-maven-plugin[os-maven-plugin] to properly
identify the platform on which this executable can run, adding said platform to the distribution's filename.

First, let's add the os-maven-plugin to the `pom.xml`. This plugin works as a Maven extension and as such must be added
to the `<build>` section of the file:

[source,xml]
----
  <build>
    <extensions>
      <extension>
        <groupId>kr.motd.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>os-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.7.1</version>
      </extension>
    </extensions>
    <!-- ... -->
----

Next, native executables on Linux and macOS platforms typically do not have a file extension but Windows executables do,
we need to take care of this when renaming the generated executable. We can also place the generated distributions into
their own directory to avoid cluttering the `target` directory. Thus, let's add a couple of properties to the existing
`<properties>` section in the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<executable-suffix/>
<distribution.directory>${project.build.directory}/distributions</distribution.directory>
----

Now we configure the maven-assembly-plugin to create a Zip and a Tar file containing the executable and any supporting files
it may need to perform its job. Take special note on the name of the distribution, this is where we make use of the platform
properties detected by the os-maven-plugin. This plugin is configured in its own profile with the `single` goal bound to
the `package` phase. It's done this way to avoid rebuilding the distribution every single time the build is invoked, as we
only needed when we're ready for a release.

[source,xml]

            <executions>
              <execution>
                <id>make-distribution</id>
                <phase>package</phase>
                <goals>
                  <goal>single</goal>
                </goals>
              </execution>
            </executions>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
    <profile>
      <id>dist-windows</id>

      </activation>
      <properties>
        <executable-suffix>.exe</executable-suffix>
      </properties>
    </profile>
----

Note that two profiles are configured. The `dist` profile configures the assembly plugin, and it's configured in such a way that
it must be activated explicitly by passing `-Pdist` as a command flag. On the other hand the `dist-windows` profile becomes
active automatically when the build is run on a Windows platform. This second profile takes care of setting the value for the
`executable-suffix` property which is required by the assembly descriptor, as shown next:

[source,xml,subs=macros+]
.src/main/assembly/assembly.xml
----
<assembly
        xmlns="pass:[http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.0]"
        xmlns:xsi="pass:[http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance]"
        xsi:schemaLocation="pass:[http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.0] pass:[http://maven.apache.org/xsd/assembly-1.1.0.xsd]">

            <destName>${project.artifactId}${executable-suffix}</destName>
        </file>
    </files>
</assembly>
----

These are the files created by the assembly plugin when invoking `./mvnw -Pdist package` on macOS:

[source]
----
$ tree target/distributions/

├── app-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-osx-x86_64.tar.gz
└── app-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-osx-x86_64.zip
----

Feel free to update the assembly descriptor to include additional files such as LICENSE, readme, or anything else needed by
the consumers of the executable. Make another commit right here with "build: Configure distribution assembly".

We're ready to go to the next phase: configuring the release.

== Adding JReleaser

The JReleaser tool can be invoked in many ways: as a CLI tool, as a Docker image, or as a Maven plugin. The last option is very
convenient given that we are already working with Maven. Let's add yet another profile that contains the release configuration
as once again we don't require this behavior to be active all the time only when we're ready to post a release:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
    <profile>
      <id>release</id>
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <groupId>org.jreleaser</groupId>
            <artifactId>jreleaser-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>{jreleaser-version}</version>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
----

There are a few goals we can invoke at this point, we can for example ask JReleaser to print out its current configuration by
invoking the `./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:config` command. The tool will output everything that it knows about the project. We
can also generate the changelog by invoking `./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:changelog`. A file containing the changelog will be
placed at `target/jreleaser/release/CHANGELOG.md` which at this point should look like this:

[source,markdown]
.target/jreleaser/release/CHANGELOG.md
----
## Changelog

8ef3307 build: Configure distribution assembly
5215200 build: Add initial sources
----

Not very exciting, but we can change this by instructing JReleaser to format the changelog according to our own conventions. You
can manually specify patterns to categorize commits however if you chose to follow Conventional Commits we can instruct JReleaser
to do the same. Add the following to the JReleaser plugin configuration section:

[source,xml]
----
            <configuration>
              <jreleaser>
                <release>
                  <github>
                    <changelog>
                      <formatted>ALWAYS</formatted>
                      <preset>conventional-commits</preset>
                    </changelog>
                  </github>
                </release>
              </jreleaser>
            </configuration>
----

Run the previous Maven command once again and inspect the generated changelog, it should now look like this:

[source,markdown]
.target/jreleaser/release/CHANGELOG.md
----
## Changelog

## 🛠  Build
- 8ef3307 Configure distribution assembly (Andres Almiray)
- 5215200 Add initial sources (Andres Almiray)


## Contributors
We'd like to thank the following people for their contributions:
Andres Almiray
----

There are more formatting options you may apply but for now these will suffice. Let's make yet another commit right now, with
"build: Configure JReleaser plugin" as a commit message. If you want you can generate the changelog once again and see this
latest commit added to the file.

== Adding distributions to the release

We've reached the point where we can configure the binary distributions. If you run the `./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:config`
command you'll notice there's no mention of any distribution files that we configured in previous steps. This is because
the tool has no implicit knowledge of them, we must tell JReleaser which files we'd like to release. This decouples creation
of distributions from release assets as you might like to add or remove files at your leisure. For this particular case we'll
configure Zip files for both macOS and Windows, and a Tar file for Linux. These files must be added to the JReleaser plugin
configuration section, like so:

[source,xml]
----
            <configuration>
              <jreleaser>
                <release>
                  <github>
                    <changelog>
                      <formatted>ALWAYS</formatted>
                      <preset>conventional-commits</preset>
                    </changelog>
                  </github>
                </release>
                <distributions>
                  <app>
                    <type>BINARY</type>
                    <artifacts>
                      <artifact>
                        <path>${distribution.directory}/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz</path>
                        <platform>linux-x86_64</platform>
                      </artifact>
                      <artifact>
                        <path>${distribution.directory}/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}-windows-x86_64.zip</path>
                        <platform>windows-x86_64</platform>
                      </artifact>
                      <artifact>
                        <path>${distribution.directory}/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}-osx-x86_64.zip</path>
                        <platform>osx-x86_64</platform>
                      </artifact>
                    </artifacts>
                  </app>
                </distributions>
              </jreleaser>
            </configuration>
----

We can appreciate a distribution named `app` (same as the project's artifactId for convenience) with 3 configured artifacts.
Note the use of Maven properties and Mustache templates to define the paths. You may use explicit values if you want or rely
on properties to parameterize the configuration. Maven properties resolve eagerly during build validation while Mustache
templates resolve lazily during the execution of the JReleaser plugin goals. Each artifact must define a `platform`
property that uniquely identifies them. If we run the `./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:config` we'll quickly get an error as now
that there's a configured distribution the plugin expects more metadata to be provided by the project:

[source]
----
[ERROR] == JReleaser ==
[ERROR] project.copyright must not be blank
[ERROR] project.description must not be blank
[ERROR] project.website must not be blank
[ERROR] project.docsUrl must not be blank
[ERROR] project.license must not be blank
[ERROR] project.authors must not be blank
----

This metadata can be provided in two ways: either as part of the JReleaser plugin's configuration or using standard
POM elements. If you choose the former option then the plugin's configuration may look like this:

[source,xml,subs=macros+]
----
            <configuration>
              <jreleaser>
                <project>
                 <description>app - Sample Quarkus CLI application</description>
                 <links>
                   <homepage>https://github.com/aalmiray/app</homepage>
                   <documentation>https://github.com/aalmiray/app</documentation>
                 </links>
                 <license>APACHE-2.0</license>

                </project>
                <!-- ... -->
----

If you choose to use standard POM elements then your `pom.xml` must contain these entries at the very least, of course
adapting values to your own:

[source,xml,subs=macros+]
----
  <name>app</name>
  <description>app -- Sample Quarkus CLI application</description>
  <inceptionYear>2021</inceptionYear>

      <url>pass:[http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt]</url>
      <distribution>repo</distribution>
    </license>
  </licenses>
----

Yet, we're not still out of the woods as invoking the `./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:config` once more will still result in
another error, this time the failure relates to missing artifacts. This is because we did not assemble all required
artifacts, yet the plugin expects them to be readily available. Here you have the choice to build the required artifacts
on other nodes then copy them to their expected locations -- a task that can be performed running a GitHub Actions
workflow on multiple nodes. Or you can instruct JReleaser to ignore some artifacts and select only those that match your
current platform. Previously we showed how the distribution would look like when created on macOS, assuming we're still on
that platform we have the correct artifact.

We can instruct JReleaser to select only artifacts that match macOS at this point by invoking the `jreleaser:config` goal
with an additional flag: `./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:config -Djreleaser.select.current.platform`. This time the command
will succeed and print out the model. Note that only the path for the macOS artifact has been fully resolved, leaving the
other 2 paths untouched.

Let's make one more commit here with "build: Configure distribution artifacts" as message. We can create a release right
now, by invoking a different goal: `./mvnw -Prelease jreleaser:release -Djreleaser.select.current.platform`. This will
create a Git release at the chosen repository, which includes tagging the repository, uploading the changelog, all
distribution artifacts and their checksum as release assets.

But before we do that let's add one additional feature, let's create a Homebrew formula that will make it easy for macOS
users to consume the binary distribution, shall we?

== Configuring Homebrew as a packager

link:https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] is a popular choice among macOS users to install and manage binaries. Homebrew packages
are at their core a Ruby file (known as a formula) that's executed on the target environment to install or upgrade a
particular binary. JReleaser can create formulae from binary distributions such as the one we already have configured.

For this to work we simply have to enable Homebrew in the JReleaser plugin configuration like so:

[source,xml]
----
                <distributions>
                  <app>
                    <type>BINARY</type>
                    <brew>
                      <active>ALWAYS</active>
                    </brew>
                    <artifacts>
                      <artifact>
                        <path>${distribution.directory}/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz</path>
                        <platform>linux-x86_64</platform>
                      </artifact>
                      <artifact>
                        <path>${distribution.directory}/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}-windows-x86_64.zip</path>
                        <platform>windows-x86_64</platform>
                      </artifact>
                      <artifact>
                        <path>${distribution.directory}/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}-osx-x86_64.zip</path>
                        <platform>osx-x86_64</platform>
                      </artifact>
                    </artifacts>
                  </app>
                </distributions>
----

One last thing: it's a good practice to publish Homebrew formulae for non-snapshot releases thus change the project's version
from `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` to say `1.0.0.Alpha1` or go directly with `1.0.0` as you feel like doing. One last commit, and we're done:
say `feat: Add Homebrew packager configuration` as commit message. Alright, we're finally ready, let's post a release!

== Creating a release

It's been quite the whirlwind tour of adding configuration to the `pom.xml` but that's just for getting the project ready for
its first release; subsequent release require less tampering with configuration. We can create a git release and the
Homebrew formula with the `jreleaser:full-release` goal but if you still have some doubts on how things may play out then
you can invoke the goal in dry-run mode that is, let JReleaser perform all local operations as needed without affecting
remote resources such as Git repositories. This is how it would look like:

[source,subs=attributes+]

JReleaser will perform the following tasks for us:

* Generate a changelog based on all commits from the last tag (if any) to the latest commit.
* Calculate SHA256 (default) checksums for all input files.
* Sign all files with GPG. In our case we did not configure this step thus it's skipped.
* Upload assets to JFrog Artifactory or AWS S3. We also skip this step as it's not configured.
* Create a Git release at the chosen repository, tagging it.
* Upload all assets, including checksums.
* Create a Homebrew formula, publishing to pass:[https://github.com/aalmiray/homebrew-tap].

Of course no remote repository was affected as we can appreciate the `-Djreleaser.dry.run=true` property was in effect. If you're
so inclined inspect the contents of `target/jreleaser/package/app/brew/Formula/app.rb` which defines the Homebrew formula
to be published. It should look something like this:

When ready, create a release for real this time by simply removing the `-Djreleaser.dry.run` flag from the command line, then
browse to your repository and look at the freshly created release.
