== Native compilation

Native executable fails on macOS with `error: unknown type name 'uint8_t'`::
Your macOS has the wrong `*.h` files compared to the OS and no gcc compilation will work.
This can happen when you migrate from versions of the OS.

The solution is to

* `sudo mv /usr/local/include /usr/local/include.old`
* Reinstall XCode for good measure
* (optional?) `brew install llvm`
* generally reinstall your brew dependencies with native compilation

The executable should work now.
