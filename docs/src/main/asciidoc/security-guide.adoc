Quarkus comes with build in security to allow for RBAC based on the common security annotations `@RolesAllowed`,
`@DenyAll`, `@PermitAll` on REST endpoints. An example of an endpoint that makes use of both JAX-RS and Common
Security annotations to describe and secure its endpoints is given in <<subject-example>>. Quarkus also provides
the `io.quarkus.security.Authenticated` annotation that will permit any authenticated user to access the resource
(equivalent to `@RolesAllowed("*"))`.

.SubjectExposingResource Example
[source,java]

import java.security.Principal;

import javax.annotation.security.DenyAll;
import javax.annotation.security.PermitAll;
import javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;

@Path("subject")
public class SubjectExposingResource {

    @GET
    @Path("secured")
    @RolesAllowed("Tester") <1>
    public String getSubjectSecured(@Context SecurityContext sec) {
        Principal user = sec.getUserPrincipal(); <2>
        String name = user != null ? user.getName() : "anonymous";
        return name;
    }

    @GET
    @Path("unsecured")
    @PermitAll<3>
    public String getSubjectUnsecured(@Context SecurityContext sec) {
        Principal user = sec.getUserPrincipal(); <4>
        String name = user != null ? user.getName() : "anonymous";
        return name;
    }

    @GET
    @Path("denied")
    @DenyAll<5>
    public String getSubjectDenied(@Context SecurityContext sec) {
        Principal user = sec.getUserPrincipal();
        String name = user != null ? user.getName() : "anonymous";
        return name;
    }
}

<1> This `/subject/secured` endpoint requires an authenticated user that has been granted the role "Tester" through the use of the `@RolesAllowed("Tester")` annotation.
<2> The endpoint obtains the user principal from the JAX-RS SecurityContext. This will be non-null for a secured endpoint.
<3> The `/subject/unsecured` endpoint allows for unauthenticated access by specifying the `@PermitAll` annotation.
<4> This call to obtain the user principal will return null if the caller is unauthenticated, non-null if the caller is authenticated.
<5> The `/subject/denied` endpoint disallows any access regardless of whether the call is authenticated by specifying the `@DenyAll` annotation.

## Security implementations

Quarkus comes with several different Security extensions that provide different functionality. This functionality is
very much a work in progress, so this list will be expanded over the coming weeks.


.Security Extensions
|===
|Extension |Description

|link:elytron-properties-guide.html[quarkus-elytron-security-properties-file]
|Provides support for simples properties files that can be used for testing security. This supports both embedding user info in `application.properties` and standalone properties files.

|link:oauth2-guide.html[quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2]
|Provides support for OAuth2 flows using Elytron. This extension will likely be deprecated soon and replaced by a reactive Vert.x version.

|link:jwt-guide.html[quarkus-smallrye-jwt]
|A Microprofile JWT implementation that provides support for authenticating using Json Web Tokens. This also allows you to inject the token and claims into the application as per the MP JWT spec.

|link:keycloak-guide.html[quarkus-vertx-keycloak]
|Provides support for authenticating via Keycloak's OpenID connect implementation.

|===

Please see the linked documents above for details on how to setup the various extensions.


### Registering Security Providers
When running in native mode the default behavior for Graal native image generation is to only include the main "SUN" provider
unless you have enabled SSL, in which case all security providers are registered. If you are not using SSL, then you can selectively
register security providers by name using the `quarkus.security.users.security-providers` property. The following example illustrates
configuration to register the "SunRsaSign" and "SunJCE" security providers:

----
quarkus.security.security-providers=SunRsaSign,SunJCE
