= Quarkus - SmallRye GraphQL Client

:extension-status: preview
include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can use the GraphQL client library.
The client is implemented by the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql/[SmallRye GraphQL] project.
This guide is specifically geared towards the client side, so if you need an introduction to GraphQL in
general, first refer to the link:smallrye-graphql[SmallRye GraphQL guide], which provides an introduction
to the GraphQL query language, general concepts and server-side development.


include::./status-include.adoc[]

The guide will walk you through developing and running a simple application that uses both supported
types of GraphQL clients to retrieve data from a remote resource, that being a database related to Star Wars.
It's available at https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql[this webpage] if you want to experiment with it manually.
The web UI allows you to write and execute GraphQL queries against it.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 11+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}

== GraphQL client types introduction

Two types of GraphQL clients are supported.

The *typesafe* client works very much like the MicroProfile REST Client adjusted for calling GraphQL endpoints.
A client instance is basically a proxy that you can call like a regular Java object, but under the hood,
the call will be translated to a GraphQL operation. It works with domain classes directly.
Any input and output objects for the operation will be translated to/from their representations
in the GraphQL query language.

The *dynamic* client, on the other hand, works rather like an equivalent of the JAX-RS client
from the `javax.ws.rs.client` package. It does not require the domain classes to work, it works with
abstract representations of GraphQL documents instead. Documents are built using a domain-specific language (DSL).
The exchanged objects are treated as an abstract `JsonObject`, but, when necessary,
it is possible to convert them to concrete model objects (if suitable model classes are available).

The typesafe client can be viewed as a rather high-level and more declarative approach designed for ease of use,
whereas the dynamic client is lower-level, more imperative, somewhat more verbose to use, but allows finer grained
control over operations and responses.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `microprofile-graphql-client-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/microprofile-graphql-client-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=microprofile-graphql-client-quickstart \
    -DclassName="org.acme.microprofile.graphql.client.StarWarsResource" \
    -Dextensions="resteasy-reactive-jsonb,graphql-client,rest-client-reactive"
cd microprofile-graphql-client-quickstart
----

NOTE: The typesafe GraphQL client depends on REST client, thus we included the `rest-client-reactive` extension
in the `extensions` list. You may also switch to the traditional non-reactive `rest-client` if the rest of
your application depends on the non-reactive RESTEasy stack (you can't mix reactive and non-reactive RESTEasy).
If you're only going to use the dynamic GraphQL client and don't use RESTEasy in your application,
you may leave out the REST client dependency completely.
This command generates a Maven project, importing the `smallrye-graphql-client` extension.

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `smallrye-graphql-client` extension
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="graphql-client,rest-client-reactive"
----

Again, you may leave out `rest-client-reactive` if you're only going to use the dynamic client.

This will add the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-graphql-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-rest-client-reactive</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== The application

The application we will build makes use of both types of GraphQL clients. In both cases,
they will connect to the Star Wars service at https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql[SWAPI] and
query it for a list of Star Wars films, and, for each film, the names of the planets which
appear in that film.

The corresponding GraphQL query looks like this:

[source]
----
{
  allFilms {
    films {
      title
      planetConnection {
        planets {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

You may go to https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql[the webpage] to execute this query manually.

== Using the Typesafe client

To use the typesafe client, we need the corresponding model classes that are compatible with
the schema. There are two ways to obtain them. First is to  use the client generator offered by SmallRye GraphQL,
which generates classes from the schema document and a list of queries. This generator is considered highly
experimental for now, and is not covered in this example. If interested, refer to the
https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql/tree/main/client/generator[Client Generator] and its documentation.

In this example, we will create a slimmed down version of the model classes manually, with only the fields
that we need, and ignore all the stuff that we don't need. We will need the classes for `Film` and `Planet`.
But, the service is also using specific wrappers named `FilmConnection` and `PlanetConnection`, which,
for our purpose, will serve just to contain the actual list of `Film` and `Planet` instances, respectively.

Let's create all the model classes and put them into the `org.acme.microprofile.graphql.client.model` package:

[source,java]
----
public class FilmConnection {

    private List<Film> films;

    public List<Film> getFilms() {
        return films;
    }

    public void setFilms(List<Film> films) {
        this.films = films;
    }
}

public class Film {

    private String title;

    private PlanetConnection planetConnection;

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public PlanetConnection getPlanetConnection() {
        return planetConnection;
    }

    public void setPlanetConnection(PlanetConnection planetConnection) {
        this.planetConnection = planetConnection;
    }
}

public class PlanetConnection {

    private List<Planet> planets;

    public List<Planet> getPlanets() {
        return planets;
    }

    public void setPlanets(List<Planet> planets) {
        this.planets = planets;
    }

}

public class Planet {

    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
----

Now that we have the model classes, we can create the interface that represents the actual set
of operations we want to call on the remote GraphQL service.

----
@GraphQLClientApi(configKey = "star-wars-typesafe")
public interface StarWarsClientApi {

    FilmConnection allFilms();

}
----

For simplicity, we're only calling the query named `allFilms`. We named our corresponding method
`allFilms` too. If we named the method differently, we would need to annotate it with
`@Query(value="allFilms")` to specify the name of the query that should be executed when this
method is called.

The client also needs some configuration, namely at least the URL of the remote service. We can either
specify that within the `@GraphQLClientApi` annotation (by setting the `endpoint` parameter),
or move this over to the configuration file, `application.properties`:

----
star-wars-typesafe/mp-graphql/url=https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index
----

`star-wars-typesafe` is the name of the configured client instance, and corresponds to the `configKey`
in the `@GraphQLClientApi` annotation. If you don't want to specify a custom name, you can leave
out the `configKey`, and then refer to it by using the fully qualified name of the interface.

Now that we have the client instance properly configured, we need a way to have it
perform something when we start the application. For that, we will use a REST endpoint that,
when called by a user, obtains the client instance and lets it execute the query.

[source, java]
----
@Path("/")
public class StarWarsResource {
    @Inject
    StarWarsClientApi typesafeClient;

    @GET
    @Path("/typesafe")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @Blocking
    public List<Film> getAllFilmsUsingTypesafeClient() {
        return typesafeClient.allFilms().getFilms();
    }
}
----

With this REST endpoint included in your application, you can simply send a GET request to `/typesafe`,
and the application will use an injected typesafe client instance to call the remote service, obtain
the films and planets, and return the JSON representation of the resulting list.

== Using the Dynamic client

For the dynamic client, the model classes are optional, because we can work with abstract
representations of the GraphQL types and documents. The client API interface is not needed at all.

We still need to configure the URL for the client, so let's put this into `application.properties`:
----
star-wars-dynamic/mp-graphql/url=https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index
----

We decided to name the client `star-wars-dynamic`. We will use this name when injecting a dynamic client
to properly qualify the injection point.

If you need to add an authorization header, or any other custom HTTP header (in our case
it's not required), this can be done by:
----
star-wars-dynamic/mp-graphql/header/HEADER-KEY=HEADER-VALUE"
----

Add this to the `StarWarsResource` created earlier:

[source,java]
----
import static io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Document.document;
import static io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Field.field;
import static io.smallrye.graphql.client.core.Operation.operation;

// ....

@Inject
@GraphQLClient("star-wars-dynamic")    // <1>
DynamicGraphQLClient dynamicClient;

@GET
@Path("/dynamic")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Blocking
public List<Film> getAllFilmsUsingDynamicClient() throws Exception {
    Document query = document(   // <2>
        operation(
            field("allFilms",
                field("films",
                    field("title"),
                    field("planetConnection",
                        field("planets",
                            field("name")
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    );
    Response response = dynamicClient.executeSync(query);   <3>
    return response.getObject(FilmConnection.class, "allFilms").getFilms();  <4>
}
----

<1> Qualifies the injection point so that we know which named client needs to be injected here.

<2> Here we build a document representing the GraphQL query, using the provided DSL language.
We use static imports to make the code easier to read. The DSL is designed in a way that
it looks quite similar to writing a GraphQL query as a string.

<3> Execute the query and block while waiting for the response. There is also an asynchronous
variant that returns a `Uni<Response>`.

<4> Here we did the optional step of converting the response to instances of our model classes,
because we have the classes available. If you don't have the classes available or don't want to
use them, simply calling `response.getData()` would get you a `JsonObject` representing
all the returned data.

== Running the application

Launch the application using

[source, bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

To execute the queries, you need to send GET requests to our REST endpoint:
[source,bash]
----
curl -s http://localhost:8080/dynamic # to use the dynamic client
curl -s http://localhost:8080/typesafe # to use the typesafe client
----

Whether you use dynamic or typesafe, the result should be the same.
If the JSON document is hard to read, you might want to run it through a tool that
formats it for better readability by humans, for example by piping the output through `jq`.

== Conclusion

This example showed how to use both the dynamic and typesafe GraphQL clients to call an external
GraphQL service and explained the difference between the client types.
