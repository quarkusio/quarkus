= Building a Native Executable

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide covers:

* Compiling the application to a native executable
* Packaging the native executable in a container
* Debugging native executable

This guide takes as input the application developed in the link:getting-started[Getting Started Guide].

== GraalVM

Building a native executable requires using a distribution of GraalVM.
There are three distributions:
Oracle GraalVM Community Edition (CE), Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition (EE) and Mandrel.
The differences between the Oracle and Mandrel distributions are as follows:

* Mandrel is a downstream distribution of the Oracle GraalVM CE.
Mandrel's main goal is to provide a way to build native executables specifically designed to support Quarkus.

* Mandrel releases are built from a code base derived from the upstream Oracle GraalVM CE code base,
with only minor changes but some significant exclusions that are not necessary for Quarkus native apps.
They support the same capabilities to build native executables as Oracle GraalVM CE,
with no significant changes to functionality.
Notably, they do not include support for polyglot programming.
The reason for these exclusions is to provide a better level of support for the majority of Quarkus users.
These exclusions also mean Mandrel offers a considerable reduction in its distribution size
when compared with Oracle GraalVM CE/EE.

* Mandrel is built slightly differently to Oracle GraalVM CE, using the standard OpenJDK project.
This means that it does not profit from a few small enhancements that Oracle have added to the version of OpenJDK used to build their own GraalVM downloads.
This enhancements are omitted because upstream OpenJDK does not manage them, and cannot vouch for.
This is particularly important when it comes to conformance and security.

* Mandrel is currently only recommended for building native executables that target Linux containerized environments.
This means that Mandrel users should use containers to build their native executables.
If you are building native executables for macOS or Windows target platforms,
you should consider using Oracle GraalVM instead,
because Mandrel does not currently target these platforms.
Building native executables directly on bare metal Linux is possible,
with details available in the https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel/blob/default/README.md[Mandrel README]
and https://github.com/graalvm/mandrel/releases[Mandrel releases].

The prerequisites vary slightly depending on whether you are using Oracle GraalVM CE/EE or Mandrel.

[IMPORTANT]
.Install the Java 11 version of GraalVM
====
While Oracle GraalVM is available for both Java 8 and Java 11 (Mandrel only supports Java 11), Quarkus only works with the Java 11 version.
If you use the Oracle distribution, make sure to install the Java 11 version.
====

== Prerequisites for Mandrel

To complete this guide using Mandrel, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 11 installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* A working container runtime (Docker, podman)
* The code of the application developed in the link:getting-started[Getting Started Guide].

Skip to <<#container-runtime,this section>> to continue with the guide for Mandrel,
and follow the Mandrel-specific instructions in that section.

== Prerequisites for Oracle GraalVM CE/EE

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 11 installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* A xref:configuring-c-development[working C development environment]
* GraalVM version {graalvm-version} (be sure to install the Java 11 support) installed and xref:configuring-graalvm[configured appropriately]
* A working container runtime (Docker, podman)
* The code of the application developed in the link:getting-started[Getting Started Guide].

.Supporting native compilation in C
[[configuring-c-development]]
[NOTE]
====
What does having a working C developer environment mean?

* On Linux, you will need GCC, and the glibc and zlib headers. Examples for common distributions:
+
[source,bash]
----
# dnf (rpm-based)
sudo dnf install gcc glibc-devel zlib-devel libstdc++-static
# Debian-based distributions:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libz-dev zlib1g-dev
----
* XCode provides the required dependencies on macOS:
+
[source,bash]
----
xcode-select --install
----
* On Windows, you will need to install the https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_buildtools.exe[Visual Studio 2017 Visual C++ Build Tools]

[[configuring-graalvm]]
=== Configuring GraalVM

[TIP]
====
If you cannot install GraalVM, you can use a multi-stage Docker build to run Maven inside a Docker container that embeds GraalVM. There is an explanation of how to do this at the end of this guide.
====

Version {graalvm-version} is required. Using the community edition is enough.

1. Install GraalVM (pick the java 11 version) if you haven't already. You have a few options for this:
** Use platform-specific install tools like https://github.com/graalvm/homebrew-tap[homebrew], https://sdkman.io/jdks#Oracle[sdkman], or https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Java[scoop].
** Download the appropriate Community Edition archive from <https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases>, and unpack it like you would any other JDK.
Make sure to download and install at Java 11 version.
2. Configure the runtime environment. Set `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory, for example:
+
[source,bash]
----
export GRAALVM_HOME=$HOME/Development/graalvm/
----
+
On macOS, point the variable to the `Home` sub-directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
export GRAALVM_HOME=$HOME/Development/graalvm/Contents/Home/
----
+
On Windows, you will have to go through the Control Panel to set your environment variables.
+
[TIP]
====
Installing via scoop will do this for you.
====
3. Install the `native-image` tool using `gu install`:
+
[source,bash]
----
${GRAALVM_HOME}/bin/gu install native-image
----
+
Some previous releases of GraalVM included the `native-image` tool by default.  This is no longer the case; it must be installed as a second step after GraalVM itself is installed. Note: there is an outstanding issue xref:graal-and-catalina[using GraalVM with macOS Catalina].
4. (Optional) Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the GraalVM installation directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
export JAVA_HOME=${GRAALVM_HOME}
----
5. (Optional) Add the GraalVM `bin` directory to the path
+
[source,bash]
----
export PATH=${GRAALVM_HOME}/bin:$PATH
----

[[graal-and-catalina]]
.Issues using GraalVM with macOS Catalina
[NOTE]
====
GraalVM binaries are not (yet) notarized for macOS Catalina as reported in this https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/1724[GraalVM issue]. This means that you may see the following error when using `gu`:

[source,bash]
----
“gu” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified
----

Use the following command to recursively delete the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute on the GraalVM install directory as a workaround:

[source,bash]
-----
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ${GRAALVM_HOME}/../..
-----
====

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and package the application step by step. However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `getting-started` directory.

== Producing a native executable

The native executable for our application will contain the application code, required libraries, Java APIs, and a reduced version of a VM. The smaller VM base improves the startup time of the application and produces a minimal disk footprint.

image:native-executable-process.png[Creating a native executable]

If you have generated the application from the previous tutorial, you can find in the `pom.xml` the following _profile_:

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>native</id>
        <properties>
            <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>
        </properties>
    </profile>
</profiles>
----

[TIP]
====
You can provide custom options for the `native-image` command using the `<quarkus.native.additional-build-args>` property.
Multiple options may be separated by a comma.

Another possibility is to include the `quarkus.native.additional-build-args` configuration property in your `application.properties`.

You can find more information about how to configure the native image building process in the <<configuration-reference>> section below.
====

We use a profile because, you will see very soon, packaging the native executable takes a _few_ minutes. You could
just pass -Dquarkus.package.type=native as a property on the command line, however it is better to use a profile as
this allows native image tests to also be run.

Create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

[[graal-and-windows]]
[NOTE]
.Issues with packaging on Windows
====
The Microsoft Native Tools for Visual Studio must first be initialized before packaging. You can do this by starting
the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt` that was installed with the Visual Studio Build Tools. At 
`x64 Native Tools Command Prompt` you can navigate to your project folder and run `mvnw package -Pnative`.

Another solution is to write a script to do this for you:

[source,bash]
----
cmd /c 'call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" && mvn package -Pnative'
----
====

In addition to the regular files, the build also produces `target/getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.
You can run it using: `./target/getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.

== Testing the native executable

Producing a native executable can lead to a few issues, and so it's also a good idea to run some tests against the application running in the native file.

In the `pom.xml` file, the `native` profile contains:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${surefire-plugin.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>integration-test</goal>
                <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <systemPropertyVariables>
                    <native.image.path>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}-runner</native.image.path>
                    <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>
                    <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>
                </systemPropertyVariables>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

This instructs the failsafe-maven-plugin to run integration-test and indicates the location of the produced native executable.

Then, open the `src/test/java/org/acme/quickstart/NativeGreetingResourceIT.java`. It contains:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.quickstart;


import io.quarkus.test.junit.NativeImageTest;

@NativeImageTest // <1>
public class NativeGreetingResourceIT extends GreetingResourceTest { // <2>

    // Run the same tests

}
----
<1> Use another test runner that starts the application from the native file before the tests.
The executable is retrieved using the `native.image.path` system property configured in the _Failsafe Maven Plugin_.
<2> We extend our previous tests, but you can also implement your tests

To see the `NativeGreetingResourceIT` run against the native executable, use `./mvnw verify -Pnative`:
[source,shell]
----

----

[TIP]
====
By default, Quarkus waits for 60 seconds for the native image to start before automatically failing the native tests. This
duration can be changed using the `quarkus.test.wait-time` system property. For example, to increase the duration
to 300 seconds, use: `./mvnw verify -Pnative -Dquarkus.test.wait-time=300`.
====

[WARNING]
====
In the future, `@NativeImageTest` will be deprecated in favor of `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` which provides a superset of the testing
capabilities of `@NativeImageTest`. More information about `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` can be found in the link:getting-started-testing#quarkus-integration-test[Testing Guide].
====

By default, native tests runs using the `prod` profile.
This can be overridden using the `quarkus.test.native-image-profile` property.
For example, in your `application.properties` file, add: `quarkus.test.native-image-profile=test`.
Alternatively, you can run your tests with: `./mvnw verify -Pnative -Dquarkus.test.native-image-profile=test`.
However, don't forget that when the native executable is built the `prod` profile is enabled.
So, the profile you enable this way must be compatible with the produced executable.

=== Excluding tests when running as a native executable

When running tests this way, the only things that actually run natively are you application endpoints, which
you can only test via HTTP calls. Your test code does not actually run natively, so if you are testing code
that does not call your HTTP endpoints, it's probably not a good idea to run them as part of native tests.

If you share your test class between JVM and native executions like we advise above, you can mark certain tests
with the `@DisabledOnNativeImage` annotation in order to only run them on the JVM.


=== Testing an existing native executable

It is also possible to re-run the tests against a native executable that has already been built. To do this run
`./mvnw test-compile failsafe:integration-test`. This will discover the existing native image and run the tests against it using
failsafe.

If the process cannot find the native image for some reason, or you want to test a native image that is no longer in the
target directory you can specify the executable with the `-Dnative.image.path=` system property.

[#container-runtime]
== Creating a Linux executable without GraalVM installed

IMPORTANT: Before going further, be sure to have a working container runtime (Docker, podman) environment. If you use Docker
on Windows you should share your project's drive at Docker Desktop file share settings and restart Docker Desktop.

Quite often one only needs to create a native Linux executable for their Quarkus application (for example in order to run in a containerized environment) and would like to avoid
the trouble of installing the proper GraalVM version in order to accomplish this task (for example, in CI environments it's common practice
to install as little software as possible).

To this end, Quarkus provides a very convenient way of creating a native Linux executable by leveraging a container runtime such as Docker or podman.
The easiest way of accomplishing this task is to execute:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
----

[TIP]
====
By default Quarkus automatically detects the container runtime.
If you want to explicitely select the container runtime, you can do it with:
[source,bash]
----
# Docker
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -Dquarkus.native.container-runtime=docker
# Podman
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -Dquarkus.native.container-runtime=podman
----

These are normal Quarkus config properties, so if you always want to build in a container
it is recommended you add these to your `application.properties` in order to avoid specifying them every time.
====

[TIP]
====
If you see the following invalid path error for your application JAR when trying to create a native executable using a container build, even though your JAR was built successfully, you're most likely using a remote daemon for your container runtime.
----
Error: Invalid Path entry getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
Caused by: java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /project/getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
----
In this case, use the parameter `-Dquarkus.native.remote-container-build=true` instead of `-Dquarkus.native.container-build=true`.

The reason for this is that the local build driver invoked through `-Dquarkus.native.container-build=true` uses volume mounts to make the JAR available in the build container, but volume mounts do not work with remote daemons. The remote container build driver copies the necessary files instead of mounting them. Note that even though the remote driver also works with local daemons, the local driver should be preferred in the local case because mounting is usually more performant than copying.
====

[TIP]
====
Building with Mandrel requires a custom builder image parameter to be passed additionally:
[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -Dquarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel:{mandrel-flavor}
----

Please note that the above command points to a floating tag.
It is highly recommended to use the floating tag,
so that your builder image remains up-to-date and secure.
If you absolutely must, you may hard-code to a specific tag
(see https://quay.io/repository/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel?tab=tags[here] for available tags),
but be aware that you won't get security updates that way and it's unsupported.
====

== Creating a container

=== Using the container-image extensions

By far the easiest way to create a container-image from your Quarkus application is to leverage one of the container-image extensions.

If one of those extensions is present, then creating a container image for the native executable is essentially a matter of executing a single command:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
----

* `quarkus.native.container-build=true` allows for creating a Linux executable without GraalVM being installed (and is only necessary if you don't have GraalVM installed locally or your local operating system is not Linux)
* `quarkus.container-image.build=true` instructs Quarkus to create a container-image using the final application artifact (which is the native executable in this case)

See the link:container-image[Container Image guide] for more details.

=== Manually

You can run the application in a container using the JAR produced by the Quarkus Maven Plugin.
However, in this section we focus on creating a container image using the produced native executable.

image:containerization-process.png[Containerization Process]

When using a local GraalVM installation, the native executable targets your local operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows etc).
However, as a container may not use the same _executable_ format as the one produced by your operating system,
we will instruct the Maven build to produce an executable by leveraging a container runtime (as described in <<#container-runtime,this section>>):

The produced executable will be a 64 bit Linux executable, so depending on your operating system it may no longer be runnable.
However, it's not an issue as we are going to copy it to a container.
The project generation has provided a `Dockerfile.native` in the `src/main/docker` directory with the following content:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY target/*-runner /work/application
RUN chmod 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

[NOTE]
.Ubi?
====
The provided `Dockerfiles` use https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=overview#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi[UBI] (Universal Base Image) as parent image.
This base image has been tailored to work perfectly in containers.
The `Dockerfiles` use the https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal[_minimal_ version] of the base image to reduce the size of the produced image.

You can read more about UBI on:

* https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=overview#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi[the UBI image page]
* https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal[the _UBI-minimal_ image page]
* https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=tags#/registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal[the list of _UBI-minimal_ tags]
====

Then, if you didn't delete the generated native executable, you can build the docker image with:

[source,bash]
----
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t quarkus-quickstart/getting-started .
----

And finally, run it with:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus-quickstart/getting-started
----

[#multistage-docker]
=== Using a multi-stage Docker build

The previous section showed you how to build a native executable using Maven or Gradle, but it requires you to have created the native executable first.
In addition, this native executable must be a Linux 64 bits executable.

You may want to build the native executable directly in a container without having a final container containing the build tools.
That approach is possible with a multi-stage Docker build:

1. The first stage builds the native executable using Maven or Gradle
2. The second stage is a minimal image copying the produced native executable

Such a multi-stage build can be achieved as follows:

Sample Dockerfile for building with Maven:
[source,dockerfile,subs=attributes+]
----
## Stage 1 : build with maven builder image with native capabilities
FROM quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-native-image:{graalvm-flavor} AS build
COPY pom.xml pom.xml
COPY mvnw mvnw
COPY .mvn .mvn
RUN ./mvnw -B org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:3.1.2:go-offline
COPY src src
RUN ./mvnw package -Pnative

## Stage 2 : create the docker final image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:8.4
WORKDIR /work/
COPY --from=build /project/target/*-runner /work/application

# set up permissions for user `1001`
RUN chmod 775 /work /work/application \
  && chown -R 1001 /work \
  && chmod -R "g+rwX" /work \
  && chown -R 1001:root /work

EXPOSE 8080
USER 1001

CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

NOTE: This multi-stage Docker build copies the Maven wrapper from the host machine.
The Maven wrapper (or the Gradle wrapper) is a convenient way to provide a specific version of Maven/Gradle.
It avoids having to create a base image with Maven and Gradle.
To provision the Maven Wrapper in your project, use: `mvn -N io.takari:maven:0.7.7:wrapper`.

Save this file in `src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage` as it is not included in the getting started quickstart.

Sample Dockerfile for building with Gradle:
[source,dockerfile,subs=attributes+]
----
## Stage 1 : build with maven builder image with native capabilities
FROM quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-native-image:{graalvm-flavor} AS build
COPY gradlew gradlew
COPY gradle gradle
COPY build.gradle build.gradle
COPY settings.gradle settings.gradle
COPY gradle.properties gradle.properties
COPY src src
RUN ./gradlew -b /project/build.gradle buildNative

## Stage 2 : create the docker final image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY --from=build /project/build/*-runner /work/application
RUN chmod 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

If you are using Gradle in your project, you can use this sample Dockerfile.  Save it in `src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage`.

[WARNING]
====
Before launching our Docker build, we need to update the default `.dockerignore` file as it filters everything except the `target` directory. As we plan to build inside a container, we need to copy the `src` directory. Thus, edit your `.dockerignore` and update the content.
====

[source,bash]
----
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage -t quarkus-quickstart/getting-started .
----

And, finally, run it with:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus-quickstart/getting-started
----

[TIP]
====
If you need SSL support in your native executable, you can easily include the necessary libraries in your Docker image.

Please see link:native-and-ssl#working-with-containers[our Using SSL With Native Executables guide] for more information.
====

NOTE: To use Mandrel instead of GraalVM CE, update the `FROM` clause to: `FROM quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel:$TAG AS build`.
`$TAG` can be found on the https://quay.io/repository/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel?tab=tags[Quarkus Mandrel Images Tags page].

=== Using a distroless base image

If you are looking for small container images, the https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless[distroless] approach reduces the size of the base layer.
The idea behind _distroless_ is the usage of a single and minimal base image containing all the requirements, and sometimes even the application itself.

Quarkus provides a distroless base image that you can use in your `Dockerfile`.
You only need to copy your application, and you are done:

[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM quay.io/quarkus/quarkus-distroless-image:1.0
COPY target/*-runner /application

EXPOSE 8080
USER nonroot

CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

TIP: Projects generated with https://code.quarkus.io already have this Dockerfile in the `src/main/docker` directory.

Quarkus provides the `quay.io/quarkus/quarkus-distroless-image:1.0` image.
It contains the required packages to run a native executable and is only **9Mb**.
Just add your application on top of this image, and you will get a tiny container image.

=== Separating Java and native image compilation

In certain circumstances, you may want to build the native image in a separate step.
For example, in a CI/CD pipeline, you may want to have one step to generate the source that will be used for the native image generation and another step to use these sources to actually build the native executable.
For this use case, you can set the `quarkus.package.type=native-sources`.
This will execute the java compilation as if you would have started native compilation (`-Pnative`), but stops before triggering the actual call to GraalVM's `native-image`.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.package.type=native-sources
----

After compilation has finished, you find the build artifact in `target/native-sources`:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd target/native-sources
$ ls
native-image.args  getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar lib
----

From the output above one can see that, in addition to the produced jar file and the associated lib directory, a text file named `native-image.args` was created.
This file holds all parameters (including the name of the JAR to compile) to pass along to GraalVM's `native-image` command.
If you have GraalVM installed, you can start the native compilation by executing:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd target/native-source
$ native-image $(cat native-image.args)
...
$ ls
native-image.args
getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.build_artifacts.txt
getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
----

The process for Gradle is analogous.

Running the build process in a container is also possible:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
cd target/native-image
docker run \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --v $(pwd):/work <1>
  -w /work <2>
  --entrypoint bin/sh \
  quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-native-image:{graalvm-flavor} \ <3>
  -c "native-image $(cat native-image.args) -J-Xmx4g" <4>
----

<1> Mount the host's directory `target/native-image` to the container's `/work`. Thus, the generated binary will also be written to this directory.
<2> Switch the working directory to `/work`, which we have mounted in <1>.
<3> Use the `quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-native-image:{graalvm-flavor}` docker image introduced in <<#multistage-docker,Using a multi-stage Docker build>> to build the native image.
<4> Call `native-image` with the content of file `native-image.args` as arguments. We also supply an additional argument to limit the process's maximum memory to 4 Gigabytes (this may vary depending on the project being built and the machine building it).

[WARNING]
====
If you are running on a Windows machine, please keep in mind that the binary was created within a Linux docker container.
Hence, the binary will not be executable on the host Windows machine.
====

A high level overview of what the various steps of a CI/CD pipeline would look is the following:

1. Register the output of the step executing `./mvnw ...` command (i.e. directory `target/native-image`) as a build artifact,
2. Require this artifact in the step executing the `native-image ...` command, and
3. Register the output of the step executing the `native-image ...` command (i.e. files matching `target/*runner`) as build artifact.

The environment executing step `1` only needs Java and Maven (or Gradle) installed, while the environment executing step `3` only needs a GraalVM installation (including the `native-image` feature).

Depending on what the final desired output of the CI/CD pipeline is, the generated binary might then be used to create a container image.

== Debugging native executable

Starting with Oracle GraalVM 20.2 or Mandrel 20.1,
debug symbols for native executables can be generated for Linux environments
(Windows support is still under development).
These symbols can be used to debug native executables with tools such as `gdb`.

To generate debug symbols,
add `-Dquarkus.native.debug.enabled=true` flag when generating the native executable.
You will find the debug symbols for the native executable in a `.debug` file next to the native executable.

[NOTE]
====
The generation of the `.debug` file depends on `objcopy`.
On common Linux distributions and macOS you will need to install the `binutils` package:

[source,bash]
----
# dnf (rpm-based)
sudo dnf install binutils
# Debian-based distributions
sudo apt-get install binutils
# macOS
brew install binutils
export PATH=/usr/local/opt/binutils/bin:$PATH
----

When `objcopy` is not available debug symbols are embedded in the executable.
====

Aside from debug symbols,
setting `-Dquarkus.native.debug.enabled=true` flag generates a cache of source files
for any JDK runtime classes, GraalVM classes and application classes resolved during native executable generation.
This source cache is useful for native debugging tools,
to establish the link between the symbols and matching source code.
It provides a convenient way of making just the necessary sources available to the debugger/IDE when debugging a native executable.

Sources for third party jar dependencies, including Quarkus source code,
are not added to the source cache by default.
To include those, make sure you invoke `mvn dependency:sources` first.
This step is required in order to pull the sources for these dependencies,
and get them included in the source cache.

The source cache is located in the `target/sources` folder.

[TIP]
====
If running `gdb` from a different directory than `target`, then the sources can be loaded by running:

[source,bash]
----
directory path/to/target
----

in the `gdb` prompt.

Or start `gdb` with:

[source,bash]
----
gdb -ex 'directory path/to/target' path/to/target/{project.name}-{project.version}-runner
----

e.g.,
[source,bash]
----
gdb -ex 'directory ./target' ./target/getting-started-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
----

[[configuration-reference]]
== Configuring the Native Executable

There are a lot of different configuration options that can affect how the native executable is generated.
These are provided in `application.properties` the same as any other config property.

The properties are shown below:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-native-pkg-native-config.adoc[opts=optional]

== What's next?

This guide covered the creation of a native (binary) executable for your application.
It provides an application exhibiting a swift startup time and consuming less memory.
However, there is much more.

We recommend continuing the journey with the link:deploying-to-kubernetes[deployment to Kubernetes and OpenShift].
