# Hibernate Search example with OpenSearch

## Running the tests

By default, the tests of this module are disabled.

To run the tests in a standard JVM with OpenSearch started in the JVM, you can run the following command:

```
mvn clean install -Dtest-containers
```

Additionally, you can generate a native image and run the tests for this native image by adding `-Dnative`:

```
mvn clean install -Dtest-containers -Dnative
```
