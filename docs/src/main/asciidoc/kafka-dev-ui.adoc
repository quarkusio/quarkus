:summary: Dev UI extension for Apache Kafka for development purposes.

If any Kafka-related extension is present (e.g. `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka`), 
the Quarkus Dev UI is extended with a Kafka broker management UI.
It is connected automatically to the Kafka broker configured for the application.

With the *Kafka Dev UI*, you can directly manage your Kafka cluster and perform tasks, such as:

* Listing and creating topics
* Visualizing records
* Publishing new records
* Inspecting the list of consumer groups and their consumption lag

IMPORTANT: Kafka Dev UI is part of the Quarkus Dev UI and is only available in development mode.
