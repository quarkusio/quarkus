This feature is currently experimental.

== Overview

When you run a Quarkus application in dev mode, you can expose a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. 
It presents the methods used by the DevUI *MCP tools* (methods you can call) and the data exposed by *MCP resources*. 

=== Connecting an MCP client

Open the **Dev UI** settings dialog and select the Dev MCP tab.
There you can enable Dev MCP, get the connection details (Default `http://localhost:8080/q/dev-mcp`) and see what clients are connected.

Any MCP client that supports the https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26[Streamable Protocol, version 2025‑03‑26] can connect using that URL. 
After a client connects, it will appears on the tab:

== Guide for extension developers

Extensions can contribute additional tools and resources to the Dev MCP server. The integration is similar to contributing to the xref:dev-ui.adoc[Dev UI], but descriptions are mandatory. 
A single JSON‑RPC service can be used for both Dev UI and Dev MCP; methods without a description only show up in Dev UI, while methods with a description appear in both.

=== MCP resources

A resource is data exposed by your extension. There are two ways to create a resource.

==== MCP Resources against build time data

Build‑time data that is already exposed to the xref:dev-ui.adoc#optional-build-time-data[Dev UI] can also be made available to Dev MCP. Provide a description when calling `addBuildTimeData()`:

[source,java]
----
footerPageBuildItem.addBuildTimeData(
    "jokes",
    jokesBuildItem.getJokes(),
    "Some funny jokes that the user might enjoy"
);
----

The extra `description` argument is new: without it the data only appears in the Dev UI. Once supplied, the `jokes` data becomes an MCP resource, however, by default this resource will be disabled. You can change the default by passing in `true` as another parameter after description, that will change this default to be enabled. Users can change this in Dev UI anyway, so this is just a sensible default.

[source,java]
----
footerPageBuildItem.addBuildTimeData(
    "jokes",
    jokesBuildItem.getJokes(),
    "Some funny jokes that the user might enjoy",
    true
);
----

==== MCP Resources against a recorded value

To expose recorded values (data produced at runtime by a recorder) as an MCP resource, define a xref:dev-ui.adoc#jsonrpc-against-a-recorded-value[build‑time action] in the deployment module. The action must include a description:

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep(onlyIf = IsLocalDevelopment.class)
BuildTimeActionBuildItem createBuildTimeActions() {
    BuildTimeActionBuildItem item = new BuildTimeActionBuildItem(); //<1>
    item.actionBuilder() //<2>
            .methodName("getMyRecordedValue")
            .description("A well‑thought‑out description") //<3>
            .runtime(runtimeValue) //<4>
            .build();
    return item;
}
----
<1> Return or produce a `BuildTimeActionBuildItem`.
<2> Use the builder to configure the action.
<3> Set a human‑readable description.
<4> Provide the runtime value returned by your recorder.

By default this resource will be disabled, and the user has to enable it in Dev UI. You can change this default by adding `.enableMcpFuctionByDefault()` in the builder method.

=== MCP tools

A tool corresponds to a method that a client can call. Any JSON‑RPC method can be exposed as a tool by supplying descriptions on the method and its parameters.
Tools can run on either the runtime or deployment classpath.

==== MCP Tools against the Runtime classpath

To expose runtime information or actions (for example, changing log levels), define a xref:dev-ui.adoc#jsonrpc-against-the-runtime-classpath[JSON‑RPC service] in your runtime or runtime‑dev module and annotate the methods and parameters with `@JsonRpcDescription`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyExtensionRPCService {

    @JsonRpcDescription("Update a specific logger's level in this Quarkus application") // <1>
    public JsonObject updateLogLevel(
            @JsonRpcDescription("The logger name as defined in the logging implementation") String loggerName,
            @JsonRpcDescription("The new log level") String levelValue) { // <2>
        // implementation…
    }
}
----
<1> Description of the method.
<2> Description of each parameter.

By default this tool will be disabled, and the user has to enable it in Dev UI. You can change this default by adding the `@DevMCPEnableByDefault` annotation on the method.

You must register the JSON‑RPC service in the deployment module:

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep
JsonRPCProvidersBuildItem registerRpcService() { // <1>
    return new JsonRPCProvidersBuildItem(MyExtensionRPCService.class); // <2>
}
----
<1> Produce a `JsonRPCProvidersBuildItem`.
<2> Specify the class in your runtime or runtime‑dev module that contains the methods.

`@JsonRpcDescription` is mandatory for Dev MCP; without it the method is only available in the Dev UI. 
The method can return primitives, `String`, `JsonObject`, `JsonArray`, or any POJO that can be serialised to JSON. 
Asynchronous methods (`Uni`, `CompletionStage` or methods annotated with `@NonBlocking`) are also supported.

==== MCP Tools against the Deployment classpath

Sometimes you need to run xref:dev-ui.adoc#jsonrpc-against-the-deployment-classpath[actions on the deployment classpath] (for example, writing configuration files). In that case you do not create a JSON‑RPC service; instead you provide a supplier via a `BuildTimeActionBuildItem`:

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep(onlyIf = IsLocalDevelopment.class)
BuildTimeActionBuildItem createBuildTimeActions() {
    BuildTimeActionBuildItem actions = new BuildTimeActionBuildItem();
    actions.actionBuilder()
            .methodName("updateProperty")
            .description("Update a configuration/property in the Quarkus application")   // <1>
            .parameter("name", "The name of the configuration/property to update")       // <2>
            .parameter("value", "The new value for the configuration/property")
            .function(map -> {
                Map<String, String> values = Collections.singletonMap(
                        map.get("name"), map.get("value"));
                updateConfig(values);
                return true;
            })
            .build();
    return actions;
}
----
<1> Description of the method.
<2> Description of each parameter.

The code in the `function` runs on the deployment classpath. The function can return a plain value, a `CompletionStage` or `CompletableFuture` for asynchronous work.

By default this tool will be disabled, and the user has to enable it in Dev UI. You can change this default by adding `.enableMcpFuctionByDefault()` in the builder method.

=== JSON‑RPC usage

By default all JSON‑RPC methods are visible in the Dev UI. Only methods with descriptions are exposed via Dev MCP. 
You can override this behaviour with the `@JsonRpcUsage` annotation. Pass one or both of the `Usage` enums (`DEV_UI`, `DEV_MCP`) to control where a method is exposed.
