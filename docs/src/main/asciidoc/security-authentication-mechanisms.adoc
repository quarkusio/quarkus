The Quarkus Security framework supports multiple authentication mechanisms, which you can use to secure your applications.
You can also combine authentication mechanisms.

[TIP]
====
Before you choose an authentication mechanism for securing your Quarkus applications, review the information provided.
====

== Overview of supported authentication mechanisms

Some supported authentication mechanisms are built into Quarkus, while others require you to add an extension.
All of these mechanisms are detailed in the following sections:

* <<built-in-authentication-mechanisms>>
* <<other-supported-authentication-mechanisms>>

The following table maps specific authentication requirements to a supported mechanism that you can use in Quarkus:

[[built-in-authentication-mechanisms]]
== Built-in authentication mechanisms

Quarkus Security provides the following built-in authentication support:

* xref:security-basic-authentication.adoc[Basic authentication]
* <<form-auth>>
* <<mutual-tls>>

[[basic-auth]]
=== Basic authentication

You can secure your Quarkus application endpoints with the built-in HTTP Basic authentication mechanism.
For more information, see the following documentation:

* xref:security-basic-authentication.adoc[Basic authentication]
** xref:security-basic-authentication-howto.adoc[Enable Basic authentication]
* xref:security-jpa.adoc[Quarkus Security with Jakarta Persistence]
** xref:security-getting-started-tutorial.adoc[Getting started with Security by using Basic authentication and Jakarta Persistence]
* xref:security-identity-providers.adoc[Identity providers]

[[form-auth]]
=== Form-based authentication

Quarkus provides form-based authentication that works similarly to traditional Servlet form-based authentication.
Unlike traditional form authentication, the authenticated user is not stored in an HTTP session because Quarkus does not support clustered HTTP sessions.
Instead, the authentication information is stored in an encrypted cookie, which can be read by all cluster members who share the same encryption key.

To apply encryption, add the `quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` property, and ensure the value you set is at least 16 characters long.
The encryption key is hashed by using SHA-256.
The resulting digest is used as a key for AES-256 encryption of the cookie value.
The cookie contains an expiry time as part of the encrypted value, so all nodes in the cluster must have their clocks synchronized.
At one-minute intervals, a new cookie gets generated with an updated expiry time if the session is in use.

To get started with form authentication, you should have similar settings as described in xref:security-basic-authentication-howto.adoc[Enable Basic authentication] and property `quarkus.http.auth.form.enabled` must be set to `true`.

Simple `application.properties` with form-base authentication can look similar to this:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.form.enabled=true

quarkus.http.auth.form.login-page=login.html
quarkus.http.auth.form.landing-page=hello
quarkus.http.auth.form.error-page=

# Define testing user
quarkus.security.users.embedded.enabled=true
quarkus.security.users.embedded.plain-text=true
quarkus.security.users.embedded.users.alice=alice
quarkus.security.users.embedded.roles.alice=user
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Configuring user names, secrets, and roles in the application.properties file is appropriate only for testing scenarios. For securing a production application, it is crucial to use a database or LDAP to store this information. For more information you can take a look at xref:security-jpa.adoc[Quarkus Security with Jakarta Persistence] or other mentioned in xref:security-basic-authentication-howto.adoc[Enable Basic authentication].
====

and application login page will contain HTML form similar to this:

[source,html]
----
<form action="/j_security_check" method="post">
    <label>Username</label>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Username" name="j_username" required>
    <label>Password</label>
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password" name="j_password" required>
    <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
----

With single-page applications (SPA), you typically want to avoid redirects by removing default page paths, as shown in the following example:

[source,properties]
----
# do not redirect, respond with HTTP 200 OK
quarkus.http.auth.form.landing-page=

# do not redirect, respond with HTTP 401 Unauthorized
quarkus.http.auth.form.login-page=
quarkus.http.auth.form.error-page=

# HttpOnly must be false if you want to log out on the client; it can be true if logging out from the server
quarkus.http.auth.form.http-only-cookie=false
----

Now that you have disabled redirects for the SPA, you must log in and log out programmatically from your client.
Below are examples of JavaScript methods for logging into the `j_security_check` endpoint and logging out of the application by destroying the cookie.

[source,javascript]
----
const login = () => {
    // Create an object to represent the form data
    const formData = new URLSearchParams();
    formData.append("j_username", username);
    formData.append("j_password", password);

    // Make an HTTP POST request using fetch against j_security_check endpoint
    fetch("j_security_check", {
        method: "POST",
        body: formData,
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        },
    })
    .then((response) => {
        if (response.status === 200) {
            // Authentication was successful
            console.log("Authentication successful");
        } else {
            // Authentication failed
            console.error("Invalid credentials");
        }
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
};
----

To log out of the SPA from the client, the cookie must be set to `quarkus.http.auth.form.http-only-cookie=false` so you can destroy
the cookie and possibly redirect back to your main page.

[source,javascript]
----
const logout= () => {
    // delete the credential cookie, essentially killing the session
    const removeCookie = `quarkus-credential=; Max-Age=0;path=/`;
    document.cookie = removeCookie;

    // perform post-logout actions here, such as redirecting back to your login page
};
----

To log out of the SPA from the server, the cookie can be set to `quarkus.http.auth.form.http-only-cookie=true` and use this example
code to destroy the cookie.

[source,java]
----
@ConfigProperty(name = "quarkus.http.auth.form.cookie-name")
String cookieName;

@Inject
CurrentIdentityAssociation identity;

@POST
public Response logout() {
    if (identity.getIdentity().isAnonymous()) {
        throw new UnauthorizedException("Not authenticated");
    }
    final NewCookie removeCookie = new NewCookie.Builder(cookieName)
            .maxAge(0)
            .expiry(Date.from(Instant.EPOCH))
            .path("/")
            .build();
    return Response.noContent().cookie(removeCookie).build();
}

----

The following properties can be used to configure form-based authentication:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-vertx-http_quarkus.http.auth.adoc[opts=optional, leveloffset=+1]

[[mutual-tls]]
=== Mutual TLS authentication

Quarkus provides mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication so that you can authenticate users based on their X.509 certificates.

To use this authentication method, you must first enable SSL/TLS for your application.
For more information, see the xref:http-reference.adoc#ssl[Supporting secure connections with SSL/TLS] section of the Quarkus "HTTP reference" guide.

After your application accepts secure connections, the next step is to configure the `quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.trust-store-file` property with the name of the file that holds all the certificates your application trusts. This file also includes information about how your application requests certificates when a client, such as a browser or another service, tries to access one of its protected resources.

Because JKS is no longer the default keystore and truststore format in Quarkus, the framework makes an educated guess based on the file extension:

* `.pem`, `.crt`, and `.key` are read as PEM certificates and keys.
* `.jks`, `.keystore`, and `.truststore` are read as JKS keystores and truststores.
* `.p12`, `.pkcs12`, and `.pfx` are read as PKCS12 keystores and truststores.

If your file does not use one of these extensions, you must set the format by using the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file-type=JKS  # or P12 or PEM
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.trust-store-file-type=JKS  # or P12 or PEM
----

JKS is becoming less commonly used. Since Java 9, the default keystore format in Java is PKCS12. The most significant difference between JKS and PKCS12 is that JKS is a format specific to Java. In contrast, PKCS12 is a standardized, language-neutral way of storing encrypted private keys and certificates.

Here is an example configuration for enabling mTLS:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file=server-keystore.jks <1>
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-password=the_key_store_secret
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.trust-store-file=server-truststore.jks <2>
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.trust-store-password=the_trust_store_secret
quarkus.http.ssl.client-auth=required <3>
quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.paths=/* <4>
quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.policy=authenticated
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled <5>
----

<1> The keystore where the server's private key is located.
<2> The truststore from which the trusted certificates are loaded.
<3> Setting `quarkus.http.ssl.client-auth` to `required` makes the server demand client certificates. You can set it to `REQUEST` if the server should accept requests without a certificate. This setting is useful when supporting multiple authentication methods besides mTLS.
<4> Defines a policy where only authenticated users can access resources from your application.
<5> Disables the plain HTTP protocol, requiring all requests to use HTTPS. When you set `quarkus.http.ssl.client-auth` to `required`, `quarkus.http.insecure-requests` is automatically disabled.

When an incoming request matches a valid certificate in the truststore, your application can obtain the subject by injecting a `SecurityIdentity` as follows:

[[x509-subject-example]]
.Obtaining the subject
[source,java]
----
@Inject
SecurityIdentity identity;

@GET
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String hello() {
    return String.format("Hello, %s", identity.getPrincipal().getName());
}
----

You can also get the certificate by using the code outlined in the following example:

[[x509-credential-example]]
.Obtaining the certificate
[source,java]
----
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import io.quarkus.security.credential.CertificateCredential;

CertificateCredential credential = identity.getCredential(CertificateCredential.class);
X509Certificate certificate = credential.getCertificate();
----

[[map-certificate-attributes-to-roles]]
==== Mapping certificate attributes to roles

The information from the client certificate can be used to add roles to Quarkus `SecurityIdentity`.

You can add new roles to `SecurityIdentity` after checking a client certificate's common name (CN) attribute.
The easiest way to add new roles is to use a certificate attribute to role mapping feature.

For example, you can update the properties shown in the section which introduces <<mutual-tls>> as follows:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file=server-keystore.jks
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-password=the_key_store_secret
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.trust-store-file=server-truststore.jks
quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.trust-store-password=the_trust_store_secret
quarkus.http.ssl.client-auth=required
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled

quarkus.http.auth.certificate-role-properties=cert-role-mappings.properties <1>

quarkus.http.auth.permission.certauthenticated.paths=/*   <2>
quarkus.http.auth.permission.certauthenticated.policy=role-policy-cert <2>
quarkus.http.auth.policy.role-policy-cert.roles-allowed=user,admin     <2>
----
<1> The `cert-role-mappings.properties` classpath resource contains a map of certificate's CN values to roles in the form `CN=role` or `CN=role1,role2`, etc. Let us assume it contains three entries: `alice=user,admin`, `bob=user` and `jdoe=tester`.
<2> Use HTTP security policy to require that `SecurityIdentity` must have either `user` or `admin` roles for the requests to be authorized.

Given the preceding configuration, the request is authorized if the client certificate's CN attribute is equal to `alice` or `bob` and forbidden if it is equal to `jdoe`.

==== Using certificate attributes to augment SecurityIdentity

You can always register `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` if the automatic <<map-certificate-attributes-to-roles>> option does not suit.
Custom `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` can check the values of different client certificate attributes and augment the `SecurityIdentity` accordingly.

For more information about customizing `SecurityIdentity`, see the xref:security-customization.adoc#security-identity-customization[Security identity customization] section in the Quarkus "Security tips and tricks" guide.

[[other-supported-authentication-mechanisms]]
== Other supported authentication mechanisms

Quarkus Security also supports the following authentication mechanisms through extensions:

ifndef::no-webauthn-authentication[]
* <<webauthn-authentication>>
endif::no-webauthn-authentication[]
* <<openid-connect-authentication>>
* <<smallrye-jwt-authentication>>
ifndef::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[]
* <<oauth2-authentication>>
endif::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[]

ifndef::no-webauthn-authentication[]
[[webauthn-authentication]]
=== WebAuthn authentication

https://webauthn.guide/[WebAuthn] is an authentication mechanism that replaces passwords.
When you write a service for registering new users, or logging them in, instead of asking for a password, you can use WebAuthn, which replaces the password.
For more information, see the xref:security-webauthn.adoc[Secure a Quarkus application by using the WebAuthn authentication mechanism] guide.
endif::no-webauthn-authentication[]

[[openid-connect-authentication]]
=== OpenID Connect authentication

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer that works on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
OIDC enables client applications to verify the identity of a user based on the authentication performed by the OIDC provider and retrieve basic information about that user.

The Quarkus `quarkus-oidc` extension provides a reactive, interoperable, multitenant-enabled OIDC adapter that supports Bearer token and Authorization Code Flow authentication mechanisms.
The Bearer token authentication mechanism extracts the token from the HTTP Authorization header.

The Authorization Code Flow mechanism redirects the user to an OIDC provider to authenticate the user's identity.
After the user is redirected back to Quarkus, the mechanism completes the authentication process by exchanging the provided code that was granted for the ID, access, and refresh tokens.

You can verify ID and access JSON Web Token (JWT) tokens by using the refreshable JSON Web Key (JWK) set or introspect them remotely.
However, opaque, also known as binary tokens, can only be introspected remotely.

[NOTE]
====
Using the Quarkus OIDC extension, both the Bearer token and Authorization Code Flow authentication mechanisms use <<smallrye-jwt-authentication>> to represent JWT tokens as MicroProfile JWT `org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken`.
====

==== Additional Quarkus resources for OIDC authentication

endif::no-quarkus-keycloak-admin-client[]
|====

[NOTE]
====
To enable the Quarkus OIDC extension at runtime, set `quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled=false` at build time.
Then, re-enable it at runtime by using a system property.

For more information about managing the individual tenant configurations in multitenant OIDC deployments, see the xref:security-openid-connect-multitenancy.adoc#disable-tenant[Disabling tenant configurations] section in the "Using OpenID Connect (OIDC) multi-tenancy" guide.
====

==== OpenID Connect client and filters

The `quarkus-oidc-client` extension provides `OidcClient` for acquiring and refreshing access tokens from OpenID Connect and OAuth2 providers that support the following token grants:

* `client-credentials`
* `password`
* `refresh_token`

The `quarkus-resteasy-client-oidc-filter` extension requires the `quarkus-oidc-client` extension.
It provides JAX-RS RESTful Web Services `OidcClientRequestFilter`, which sets the access token acquired by `OidcClient` as the `Bearer` scheme value of the HTTP `Authorization` header.
This filter can be registered with MicroProfile REST client implementations injected into the current Quarkus endpoint, but it is not related to the authentication requirements of this service endpoint.
For example, it can be a public endpoint or be protected with mTLS.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In this scenario, you do not need to protect your Quarkus endpoint by using the Quarkus OpenID Connect adapter.
====

The `quarkus-resteasy-client-oidc-token-propagation` extension requires the `quarkus-oidc` extension.
It provides Jakarta REST `TokenCredentialRequestFilter`, which sets the OpenID Connect Bearer token or Authorization Code Flow access token as the `Bearer` scheme value of the HTTP `Authorization` header.
This filter can be registered with MicroProfile REST client implementations injected into the current Quarkus endpoint, which must be protected by using the Quarkus OIDC adapter.
This filter can propagate the access token to the downstream services.

For more information, see the xref:security-openid-connect-client.adoc[OpenID Connect client and token propagation quickstart] and xref:security-openid-connect-client-reference.adoc[OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth2 client and filters reference] guides.


[[smallrye-jwt-authentication]]
=== SmallRye JWT authentication

The `quarkus-smallrye-jwt` extension provides a MicroProfile JSON Web Token (JWT) 2.1 implementation and multiple options to verify signed and encrypted `JWT` tokens.
It represents them as `org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken`.

`quarkus-smallrye-jwt` is an alternative to the `quarkus-oidc` Bearer token authentication mechanism and verifies only `JWT` tokens by using either Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) keys or the refreshable `JWK` key set.
`quarkus-smallrye-jwt` also provides the JWT generation API, which you can use to easily create `signed`, `inner-signed`, and `encrypted` `JWT` tokens.

For more information, see the xref:security-jwt.adoc[Using JWT RBAC] guide.

ifndef::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[]
[[oauth2-authentication]]
=== OAuth2 authentication

`quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2` provides an alternative to the Quarkus `quarkus-oidc` Bearer token authentication mechanism extension.
`quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2` is based on `Elytron` and is primarily intended for introspecting opaque tokens remotely.

For more information, see the Quarkus xref:security-oauth2.adoc[Using OAuth2] guide.
endif::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[]

[[oidc-jwt-oauth2-comparison]]
== Choosing between OpenID Connect, SmallRye JWT, and OAuth2 authentication mechanisms

Use the following information to select the appropriate token authentication mechanism to secure your Quarkus applications.

.List of authentication mechanism use cases

* `quarkus-oidc` requires an OpenID Connect provider such as Keycloak, which can verify the bearer tokens or authenticate the end users with the Authorization Code flow.
In both cases, `quarkus-oidc` requires a connection to the specified OpenID Connect provider.

* If the user authentication requires Authorization Code flow, or you need to support multiple tenants, use `quarkus-oidc`.
`quarkus-oidc` can also request user information by using both Authorization Code Flow and Bearer access tokens.

ifndef::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[]
* If your bearer tokens must be verified, use `quarkus-oidc`, `quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2`, or `quarkus-smallrye-jwt`.
endif::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[]
ifdef::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[]
* If your bearer tokens must be verified, use `quarkus-oidc` or `quarkus-smallrye-jwt`.
endif::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[]

* If your bearer tokens are in a JSON web token (JWT) format, you can use any extensions in the preceding list.
Both `quarkus-oidc` and `quarkus-smallrye-jwt` support refreshing the `JsonWebKey` (JWK) set when the OpenID Connect provider rotates the keys.
Therefore, if remote token introspection must be avoided or is unsupported by the providers, use `quarkus-oidc` or `quarkus-smallrye-jwt` to verify JWT tokens.

* To introspect the JWT tokens remotely, you can use `quarkus-oidc`
ifndef::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[or `quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2`]
for verifying the opaque or binary tokens by using remote introspection.
`quarkus-smallrye-jwt` does not support the remote introspection of both opaque or JWT tokens but instead relies on the locally available keys that are usually retrieved from the OpenID Connect provider.

* `quarkus-oidc` and `quarkus-smallrye-jwt` support the JWT and opaque token injection into the endpoint code.
Injected JWT tokens provide more information about the user.
All extensions can have the tokens injected as `Principal`.

* `quarkus-smallrye-jwt` supports more key formats than `quarkus-oidc`.
`quarkus-oidc` uses only the JWK-formatted keys that are part of a JWK set, whereas `quarkus-smallrye-jwt` supports PEM keys.

* `quarkus-smallrye-jwt` handles locally signed, inner-signed-and-encrypted, and encrypted tokens.
ifndef::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[In contrast, although `quarkus-oidc` and `quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2` can also verify such tokens, they treat them as opaque tokens and verify them through remote introspection.]
ifdef::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[In contrast, although `quarkus-oidc` can also verify such tokens, it treats them as opaque tokens and verifies them through remote introspection.]

ifndef::no-quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2[* If you need a lightweight library for the remote introspection of opaque or JWT tokens, use `quarkus-elytron-security-oauth2`.]

[NOTE]
====
Architectural considerations drive your decision to use opaque or JSON web token (JWT) token format.
Opaque tokens tend to be much shorter than JWT tokens but need most of the token-associated state to be maintained in the provider database.
Opaque tokens are effectively database pointers.

JWT tokens are significantly longer than opaque tokens.
Nonetheless, the providers effectively delegate most of the token-associated state to the client by storing it as the token claims and either signing or encrypting them.

[[combining-authentication-mechanisms]]
== Combining authentication mechanisms

If different sources provide the user credentials, you can combine authentication mechanisms.
For example, you can combine the built-in Basic and the Quarkus `quarkus-oidc` Bearer token authentication mechanisms.

The authentication process completes as soon as the first `SecurityIdentity` is produced by one of the authentication mechanisms.

In some cases it can be required that all registered authentication mechanisms create their `SecurityIdentity`.
It can be required when the credentials such as tokens have to be passed over <<mutual-tls>>,
for example, when users are authenticating via `Virtual Private Network`, or when the current token has to be bound
to the client certificate for the token verification to succeed, guaranteeing that the token was issued exactly
to the same client which is currently passing this token to Quarkus alongside its client certificate.

In Quarkus such authentication is called `inclusive` and you can enable it like this:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.inclusive=true
----

If the authentication is inclusive then `SecurityIdentity` created by the first authentication mechanism can be
injected into the application code.
For example, if both <<mutual-tls>> and basic authentication mechanism authentications are required,
the <<mutual-tls>> mechanism will create `SecurityIdentity` first.

NOTE: The <<mutual-tls>> mechanism has the highest priority when inclusive authentication is enabled, to ensure
that an injected `SecurityIdentity` always represents <<mutual-tls>> and can be used to get access to `SecurityIdentity`
identities provided by other authentication mechanisms.

Additional `SecurityIdentity` instances can be accessed as a `quarkus.security.identities` attribute on the first
`SecurityIdentity`, however, accessing these extra identities directly may not be necessary, for example,
when both <<mutual-tls>> and xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc[OIDC Bearer authentication] mechanisms
have been combined and done their authentications, the authenticated bearer token can be injected as a token
credential alongside `SecurityIdentity` created by <<mutual-tls>>. This is exemplified below:

[source,java]
----

<1> This is the `SecurityIdentity` created by applicable authentication mechanism with the highest priority.
<2> Other applicable authentication mechanisms performed authentication and are available on the `SecurityIdentity`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot combine the Quarkus `quarkus-oidc` Bearer token and `smallrye-jwt` authentication mechanisms because both mechanisms attempt to verify the token extracted from the HTTP Bearer token authentication scheme.
====

=== Use HTTP Security Policy to enable path-based authentication

The following configuration example demonstrates how you can enforce a single selectable authentication mechanism for a given request path:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.permission.basic-or-bearer.paths=/service
quarkus.http.auth.permission.basic-or-bearer.policy=authenticated

quarkus.http.auth.permission.basic.paths=/basic-only
quarkus.http.auth.permission.basic.policy=authenticated
quarkus.http.auth.permission.basic.auth-mechanism=basic

quarkus.http.auth.permission.bearer.paths=/bearer-only
quarkus.http.auth.permission.bearer.policy=authenticated
quarkus.http.auth.permission.bearer.auth-mechanism=bearer
----

Ensure that the value of the `auth-mechanism` property matches the authentication scheme supported by `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`, for example, `basic`, `bearer`, or `form`.

=== Use annotations to enable path-based authentication for Jakarta REST endpoints

It is possible to use annotations to select an authentication mechanism specific to each Jakarta REST endpoint.
This feature is only enabled when <<proactive-auth>> is disabled due to the fact that the annotations can only be used
to select authentication mechanisms after a REST endpoint has been matched.
Here is how you can select an authentication mechanism per a REST endpoint basis:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.proactive=false
----

[source,java]
----
import io.quarkus.oidc.AuthorizationCodeFlow;
import io.quarkus.vertx.http.runtime.security.annotation.BasicAuthentication;
import jakarta.annotation.security.RolesAllowed;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

@Path("hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @BasicAuthentication <1> <2>
    @Path("basic")
    public String basicAuthMechanism() {
        return "basic";
    }

    @GET
    @RolesAllowed("admin") <3>
    @AuthorizationCodeFlow <4>
    @Path("code-flow")
    public String codeFlowAuthMechanism() {
        return "code-flow";
    }
}
----
<1> The REST endpoint `/hello/basic` can only ever be accessed by using the <<basic-auth>>.
<2> This endpoint requires authentication, because when no standard security annotation accompanies the `@BasicAuthentication` annotation, the `@Authenticated` annotation is added by default.
<3> The `@AuthorizationCodeFlow` annotation can be combined with any other standard security annotation like `@RolesAllowed`, `@PermissionsAllowed` and others.
<4> The REST endpoint `/hello/code-flow` can only ever be accessed by using the xref:security-oidc-code-flow-authentication.adoc[OIDC authorization code flow mechanism].

s|OIDC authorization code flow mechanism
^|`io.quarkus.oidc.AuthorizationCodeFlow`

s|SmallRye JWT authentication mechanism
^|`io.quarkus.smallrye.jwt.runtime.auth.BearerTokenAuthentication`

|===

TIP: Quarkus automatically secures endpoints annotated with the authentication mechanism annotation. When no standard security annotation is present on the REST endpoint and resource, the `io.quarkus.security.Authenticated` annotation is added for you.

It is also possible to use the `io.quarkus.vertx.http.runtime.security.annotation.HttpAuthenticationMechanism` annotation to select any authentication mechanism based on its scheme.
Annotation-based analogy to the `quarkus.http.auth.permission.basic.auth-mechanism=custom` configuration property is the `@HttpAuthenticationMechanism("custom")` annotation.

NOTE: For consistency with various Jakarta EE specifications, it is recommended to always repeat annotations instead of relying on annotation inheritance.

==== How to combine it with HTTP Security Policy

The easiest way to define roles that are allowed to access individual resources is the `@RolesAllowed` annotation.
Nevertheless, it is also possible to use the HTTP Security Policy like in the example below:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.policy.roles1.roles-allowed=user
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.paths=/hello/code-flow
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.applies-to=JAXRS <1>
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.policy=roles1
quarkus.http.auth.permission.roles1.methods=GET <2>
----
<1> Delay this policy's permission check after the endpoint-specific authentication mechanism has been selected.
<2> Make the `roles1` permission match only the endpoint annotated with the `@AuthorizationCodeFlow` annotation.
Unannotated endpoints must avoid the delay caused by the `applies-to=JAXRS` option.

[[proactive-auth]]
== Proactive authentication

Proactive authentication is enabled in Quarkus by default.
This means that if an incoming request has a credential, the request will always be authenticated, even if the target page does not require authentication.
For more information, see the Quarkus xref:security-proactive-authentication.adoc[Proactive authentication] guide.
