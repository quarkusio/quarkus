= Dev Services for Kafka

include::./attributes.adoc[]

If any Kafka-related extension is present (e.g. `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka`), Dev Services for Kafka automatically starts a Kafka broker in dev mode and when running tests.
So, you don't have to start a broker manually.
The application is configured automatically.

IMPORTANT: Because starting a Kafka broker can be long, Dev Services for Kafka uses https://vectorized.io/redpanda[Redpanda], a Kafka compatible broker which starts in ~1 second.

== Enabling / Disabling Dev Services for Kafka

Dev Services for Kafka is automatically enabled unless:

- `quarkus.kafka.devservices.enabled` is set to `false`
- the `kafka.bootstrap.servers` is configured
- all the Reactive Messaging Kafka channels have the `bootstrap.servers` attribute set

Dev Services for Kafka relies on Docker to start the broker.
If your environment does not support Docker, you will need to start the broker manually, or connect to an already running broker.
You can configure the broker address using `kafka.bootstrap.servers`.

== Shared broker

Most of the time you need to share the broker between applications.
Dev Services for Kafka implements a _service discovery_ mechanism for your multiple Quarkus applications running in _dev_ mode to share a single broker.

NOTE: Dev Services for Kafka starts the container with the `quarkus-dev-service-kafka` label which is used to identify the container.

If you need multiple (shared) brokers, you can configure the `quarkus.kafka.devservices.service-name` attribute and indicate the broker name.
It looks for a container with the same value, or starts a new one if none can be found.
The default service name is `kafka`.

Sharing is enabled by default in dev mode, but disabled in test mode.
You can disable the sharing with `quarkus.kafka.devservices.shared=false`.

== Setting the port

By default, Dev Services for Kafka picks a random port and configures the application.
You can set the port by configuring the `quarkus.kafka.devservices.port` property.

Note that the Kafka advertised address is automatically configured with the chosen port.

== Configuring the image

Dev Services for Kafka uses: `vectorized/redpanda` images.
You can select any version from https://hub.docker.com/r/vectorized/redpanda:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.kafka.devservices.image-name=vectorized/redpanda:latest
----

IMPORTANT: Dev Services for Kafka only support Redpanda.
