     * generated more often), however larger values affect the inactivity timeout as the timeout is set
     * when a cookie is generated.
     *
     * For example if this is set to 10 minutes, and the inactivity timeout is 30m, if a users last request
     * is when the cookie is 9m old then the actual timeout will happen 21m after the last request, as the timeout
     * is only refreshed when a new cookie is generated.
     *
     * In other words no timeout is tracked on the server side; the timestamp is encoded and encrypted in the cookie itself
     * and it is decrypted and parsed with each request.
