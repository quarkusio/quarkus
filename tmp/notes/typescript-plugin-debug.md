# TypeScript Plugin Debug Analysis

## Issue Identified
The user reports "I don't see any projects again" - meaning the new TypeScript plugin isn't generating projects.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Working Version (maven-plugin.js)
- Uses complex JavaScript-based Maven parsing
- Successfully finds 949 projects 
- Takes ~2 minutes to process (timeout issue but works)

### New Version (maven-plugin2.ts) Issues
1. **Java Analyzer Dependency**: Relies on compiled Java program that might not be available in test/runtime
2. **Caching Removed**: We removed caching but may have broken project discovery flow
3. **Error Handling**: Java analyzer failures cause entire plugin to return empty results

## Current Status
- **Tests**: Failing because Java analyzer not found in test environment
- **Runtime**: Likely failing because Java analyzer path issues or compilation problems

## Solution Options
1. **Fallback Mode**: Add fallback to basic Maven parsing when Java analyzer fails
2. **Java Analyzer Fix**: Ensure Java analyzer is properly compiled and accessible
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use Java for complex analysis, fallback for basic project discovery

## Immediate Action
Need to ensure the TypeScript plugin can find projects even when Java analyzer is unavailable, so users see projects immediately.
