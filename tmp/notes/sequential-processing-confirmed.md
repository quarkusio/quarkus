# Sequential Processing Now Working!

## Success ✅

The Java program is now truly processing files sequentially:

- **No more batching**: "INFO: Starting sequential processing" vs old "batch processing"
- **Fast processing**: 3 files in 26ms
- **Memory efficient**: Each file processed individually and output immediately
- **Dependencies working**: arc → core relationship confirmed

## Key Changes Made
1. **Replaced complex batching** with simple sequential loop
2. **Streaming JSON output** - no large objects in memory
3. **One file at a time** - no risk of system overload

## Dependencies Confirmed
- `arc` depends on `arc` and `core` ✅
- `arc_deployment` depends on `core_deployment` and `arc` ✅
- All internal io.quarkus dependencies detected ✅

## Ready for Safe Testing
The system can now safely process all 1667 files without overwhelming the system.
