But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer
 of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
 because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
 consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
  pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
   procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
    exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
    chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
    resultant pleasure?
