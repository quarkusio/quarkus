== Guidelines for good How-To guides

- Donâ€™t explain concepts; link to a related concept/explainer.
- Be flexible; a how-to guide needs to be adaptable to real-world use cases.
- Omit the unnecessary; practical usability is more helpful than completeness.
- A how-to guide can include multiple tasks, each with its own H2 heading.
- For suggestions on how to write a good how-to guide, see https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/#writing-a-good-how-to-guide.

== Examples

Baeldung tutorials provide solid examples of How-To guides.
For example, "How to use Jackson annotations" is answered (with variations) here: https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-annotations
