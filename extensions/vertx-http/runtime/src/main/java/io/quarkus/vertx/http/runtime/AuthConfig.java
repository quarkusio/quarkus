     * authentication, for example, OIDC bearer token authentication, must succeed.
     * In such cases, `SecurityIdentity` created by the first mechanism, mTLS, can be injected, identities created
     * by other mechanisms will be available on `SecurityIdentity`.
     * The mTLS mechanism is always the first mechanism, because its priority is elevated when inclusive authentication
     * is enabled.
     * The identities can be retrieved using utility method as in the example below:
     *
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * io.quarkus.vertx.http.runtime.security.HttpSecurityUtils.getSecurityIdentities(securityIdentity)
     * }

     * `SecurityIdentity` is created.
     * <p>
     * This property will be ignored if the path specific authentication is enabled.
