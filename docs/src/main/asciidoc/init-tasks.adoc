= Initialization tasks
:categories: initialization
:summary: This reference guide explains how to configure initialization tasks
:topics: init,kubernetes,openshift,liquibase,flyway
:extensions: io.quarkus:quarkus-kubernetes,io.quarkus:quarkus-openshift,io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway,io.quarkus:quarkus-liquibase

There are often initialization tasks performed by Quarkus extensions that are meant to be run once.
For example, Flyway or Liquibase initialization falls into that category. But what happens when the scaling
needs of an application requires more instances of the application to run? Or what happens when the application
restarts ?

A common environment where both of these cases are pretty common is Kubernetes. To address these challenges,
Quarkus allows externalization of such tasks as Kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/[Jobs] and uses https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/[init containers] to ensure that an
application instance only starts once the initialization jobs have finished. With this approach even if an
application has multiple replicas, the initialization logic will only run once.

This approach is reflected in the manifests generated by xref:deploying-to-kubernetes.adoc#kubernetes[Kubernetes extension].

== Disabling the feature

The feature can be explictily disabled per task (enabled by default).
The default behavior can change by setting the following property to `false`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-task-defaults.enabled=false
----

or on OpenShift:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.openshift.init-task-defaults.enabled=false
----

**Note**: All the configuration options in this guide are available on both OpenShift and Kubernetes. The rest of the guide will use Kubernetes(`quarkus.kubernetes` prefix)
configuration prefix, but all the configuration options are also available for OpenShift(`quarkus.openshift` prefix) too.

In the case where we need to disable a particular task, we can use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-tasks."<task name>".enabled=false
----

The task name is the name of the extension that performs the initialization.
Examples:

For Flyway:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-tasks.flyway.enabled=false
----

For Liquibase:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-tasks.liquibase.enabled=false
----

For Liquibase Mongodb:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-tasks.liquibase-mongodb.enabled=false
----


== Controlling the generated job

The job container is pretty similar to the application container, and the only thing that changes is the configured environment variables.
More specifically, the following environment variable is added, to tell the job to exit right after initialization.

[source,properties]
----
QUARKUS_INIT_AND_EXIT=true
----

The image, image pull policy, service account, volumes, mounts and additional environment variables are inherited/copied from the deployment resource.
Any customization to the original deployment resource (via configuration or extension) will also be reflected in the job.

== Controlling the generated init container

The name of the generated init container is `wait-for-${task name}` by default.
Given that the init container is part of the same pod as the actual application it will get the same service account (and therefore permissions) and volumes as the application.
Further customization to the container can be done using using the configuration options for init containers (see `quarkus.kubernetes.init-containers` or `quarkus.openshift.init-containers`).

Examples:

To set the imagePullPolicy to `IfNotPresent` on the init container that waits for the `flyway` job:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-containers.wait-for-flyway.image-pull-policy=IfNotPresent
----

To set custom command (say `custom-wait-for`) on the init container that waits for the `flyway` job:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-containers.wait-for-flyway.command=custom-wait-for
----


== Orchestration of the initialization tasks

The deployment resource should not start until the job has been completed. The typical pattern that is used among Kubernetes users is the
use of init containers to achieve this. An init container that `wait for` the job to complete is enough to enforce that requirement.

=== Using a custom wait-for container image

To change the `wait-for` image which by default is `groundnuty/k8s-wait-for:no-root-v1.7` you can use:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-task-defaults.wait-for-container.image=my/wait-for-image:1.0
----

To change the `wait-for` image for a particular init container (e.g. `wait-for-flway`) you can use:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.kubernetes.init-containers.wait-for-flyway=my/wait-for-image:1.0
----

=== Configuring permissions

For an init container to be able to perform the `wait for job` it needs to be able to perform `get` operations on the job resource.
This is done automatically and the generated manifests include the required `Role` and `RoleBinding` resources.

If for any reason additional permissions are required either by the init container or the job, they can be configured with through the xref:deploying-to-kubernetes.adoc#generating-rbac-resources[Kubernetes RBAC configuration].

**Note**: The application, the init container and the job use the same `ServiceAccount` and therefore, share the same permissions.

== Extension providing Initialization Tasks

Currently, this feature is used by the following extensions:
- xref:flyway.adoc[Flyway]
- xref:liquibase.adoc[Liquibase]
- xref:liquibase-mongodb.adoc[Liquibase MongoDB]
