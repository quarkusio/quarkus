This document explains various Undertow features that you can use in Quarkus.


=== Serving Static Resources

To serve static resources you must place them in the `META-INF/resources` directory of your application. This is because
Quarkus applications are jar files rather than war files, and this location is the standard location for resources in
jar files as defined by the Servlet spec.

=== undertow-handlers.conf

You can make use of the Undertow predicate language using an `undertow-handlers.conf` file. This file should be placed
in the `META-INF` directory of your application jar. This file contains handlers defined using the
