    /**
     * Configures the connection string.
     * The format is:
     * {@code  mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database.collection][?options]]}
     * <p>
     * {@code mongodb://} is a required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format.
     * <p>
     * {@code username:password@} are optional. If given, the driver will attempt to login to a database after
     * connecting to a database server. For some authentication mechanisms, only the username is specified and the
     * password is not, in which case the ":" after the username is left off as well.
     * <p>
     * {@code host1} is the only required part of the connection string. It identifies a server address to connect to.
     * <p>
     * {@code :portX} is optional and defaults to :27017 if not provided.
     * <p>
     * {@code /database} is the name of the database to login to and thus is only relevant if the
     * {@code username:password@} syntax is used. If not specified the {@code admin} database will be used by default.
     * <p>
     * {@code ?options} are connection options. Note that if {@code database} is absent there is still a {@code /}
     * required between the last host and the {@code ?} introducing the options. Options are name=value pairs and the
     * pairs are separated by "&amp;".
     * <p>
     * An alternative format, using the {@code mongodb+srv} protocol, is:
     *
     * <pre>
     *  mongodb+srv://[username:password@]host[/[database][?options]]
     * </pre>
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code mongodb+srv://} is a required prefix for this format.</li>
     * <li>{@code username:password@} are optional. If given, the driver will attempt to login to a database after
     * connecting to a database server. For some authentication mechanisms, only the username is specified and the
     * password is not, in which case the ":" after the username is left off as well</li>
     * <li>{@code host} is the only required part of the URI. It identifies a single host name for which SRV records
     * are looked up from a Domain Name Server after prefixing the host name with {@code "_mongodb._tcp"}. The
     * host/port for each SRV record becomes the seed list used to connect, as if each one were provided as host/port
     * pair in a URI using the normal mongodb protocol.</li>
     * <li>{@code /database} is the name of the database to login to and thus is only relevant if the
     * {@code username:password@} syntax is used. If not specified the "admin" database will be used by default.</li>
     * <li>{@code ?options} are connection options. Note that if {@code database} is absent there is still a {@code /}
     * required between the last host and the {@code ?} introducing the options. Options are name=value pairs and the
     * pairs are separated by "&amp;". Additionally with the mongodb+srv protocol, TXT records are looked up from a
     * Domain Name Server for the given host, and the text value of each one is prepended to any options on the URI
     * itself. Because the last specified value for any option wins, that means that options provided on the URI will
     * override any that are provided via TXT records.</li>
     * </ul>
