.About the Duration format
====
To write duration values, use the standard `java.time.Duration` format.
See the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html#parse(java.lang.CharSequence)[Duration#parse() Java API documentation] for more information.

You can also use a simplified format, starting with a number:

* If the value is only a number, it represents time in seconds.
* If the value is a number followed by `ms`, it represents time in milliseconds.

In other cases, the simplified format is translated to the `java.time.Duration` format for parsing:

* If the value is a number followed by `h`, `m`, or `s`, it is prefixed with `PT`.
* If the value is a number followed by `d`, it is prefixed with `P`.
