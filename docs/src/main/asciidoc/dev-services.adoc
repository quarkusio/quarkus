= Dev Services Overview

include::./attributes.adoc[]

Quarkus supports the automatic provisioning of unconfigured services in development and test mode. We refer to this capability
as Dev Services. From a developers perspective this means that if you include an extension and don't configure it then
Quarkus will automatically start the relevant service (usually using https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] behind the scenes) and wire up your
application to use this service.

All this functionality is part of the Quarkus `deployment` modules, so does not affect the production application in any
way. If you want to disable all Dev Services you can use the `quarkus.devservices.enabled=false` config property, although
in most cases this is not necessary as simply configuring the service will result in the Dev Service being disabled automatically.

This page lists all the Dev Services that Quarkus supports.

NOTE: In order to use Dev Services you will generally need a working Docker environment (remote environments are supported).
If you don't have Docker installed you will need to configure your services normally.

== AMQP

The AMQP Dev Service will be enabled when the `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-amqp` extension is present in your application, and
the broker address has not been explicitly configured. More information can be found at the
link:amqp-dev-services[AMQP Dev Services Guide].

== Apicurio Registry

The Apicurio Dev Service will be enabled when the `quarkus-apicurio-registry-avro` extension is present in your application, and it's
address has not been explicitly configured. More information can be found at the
link:apicurio-registry-dev-services[Apicurio Registry Dev Services Guide].

== Databases

The database Dev Services will be enabled when a reactive or JDBC datasource extension is present in the application,
and the database URL has not been configured. More information can be found at the
link:datasource#dev-services[Datasource Guide].

Quarkus provides Dev Services for all databases it supports except Oracle. Most of these are run in a container, with the
exception of H2 and Derby which are run in process. Dev Services are supported for both JDBC and reactive drivers.

the broker address has not been explicitly configured. More information can be found at the
link:kafka-dev-services[Kafka Dev Services Guide].
