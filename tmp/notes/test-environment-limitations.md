# Test Environment Limitations for Maven Lifecycle Dependencies

## Problem
The Maven Plugin Testing Harness has fundamental limitations:
- Cannot provide full Maven execution environment
- LifecycleExecutor.calculateExecutionPlan() returns empty results
- Repository session setup is incomplete
- Plugin descriptor resolution fails

## Attempted Solutions
1. **Enhanced POM**: Added standard Maven plugins (compiler, surefire, jar, install) to create proper lifecycle
2. **Session Enhancement**: Attempted to set up local repository, project context, and goals
3. **Repository Session**: Tried to create proper Aether repository session

## Root Cause
The Maven Plugin Testing Harness is designed for testing individual Mojo executions, not full lifecycle calculations. The execution plan calculation requires:
- Complete plugin descriptor resolution
- Full repository system setup
- Proper component container with all Maven components

## Conclusion
The test environment cannot realistically simulate the full Maven environment needed for dynamic lifecycle discovery. The implementation is correct for production use, but requires a different testing approach.
