== The multiple reactive facets of Quarkus

Quarkus is reactive.
If you look under the hood, you will find a reactive engine powering your Quarkus application.
This engine is Eclipse Vert.x (https://vertx.io).
All network I/O passes through the non-blocking and reactive Vert.x engine.

image:quarkus-reactive-stack.png[alt=Quarkus is based on a reactive engine, 70%]

Let's take 2 examples to explain how it works.
Imagine an incoming HTTP request.
The (Vert.x) HTTP server, embedded in Quarkus, receives the request and then routes it to the application.
If the request targets an _imperative_ method (traditional JAX-RS, code annotated with `@Blocking`...), the routing layer invokes the resource method in a _worker_ thread and writes the response when the data is available.
So far, nothing new or outstanding.
The following picture depicts this behavior.
In this case, the application code is invoked on a worker thread, and the business logic can block that thread.

image:http-blocking-sequence.png[alt=Behavior when using the imperative routes, 70%]

But, if the HTTP request targets a reactive method (JAX-RS using RESTEasy Reactive, reactive routes, `@Incoming` method not annotated with `@Blocking`...), the routing layer invokes the route on the I/O thread giving lots of benefits such as higher concurrency and performance:

image:http-reactive-sequence.png[alt=Behavior when using the reactive routes, 70%]

Because Quarkus uses the I/O thread to invoke your code, we save context-switches, avoid large thread pool management, and so improve the resource utilization.
However, the code must **NOT** block that thread.
Why? Because, I/O threads are used to handle multiple concurrent requests.
As soon as the handling of a request cannot make progress because it needs to execute some I/O, it schedules these I/O and passes a continuation.
It releases the thread which can handle another request.
When the scheduled I/O complete, the continuation is executed, back on the I/O thread.

As a consequence, many Quarkus components are designed with reactive in mind, such as database access (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Mongo, etc.), application services (mail, template engine, etc.), messaging (Kafka, AMQP, etc.) and so on.
But, to fully benefit from this model, the application code should be written in a non-blocking manner.
That’s where having a reactive API is an ultimate weapon.

[[mutiny]]
== Mutiny - A reactive programming library

https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny[Mutiny] is a reactive programming library allowing to express and compose asynchronous actions.
It offers two types:

* `io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni` - for asynchronous action providing 0 or 1 result
* `io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi` - for multi-item (with back-pressure) streams

Both types are lazy and follow a subscription pattern.
The computation only starts once there is an actual need for it (i.e. a subscriber enlists).

[source, java]
----
uni.subscribe().with(
    result -> System.out.println("result is " + result),
    failure -> failure.printStackTrace()
);

multi.subscribe().with(
    item -> System.out.println("Got " + item),
    failure -> failure.printStackTrace()
);
----

Both `Uni` and `Multi` expose event-driven APIs: you express what you want to do upon a given event (success, failure, etc.).
These APIs are divided into groups (types of operations) to make it more expressive and avoid having 100s of methods attached to a single class.
The main types of operations are about reacting to failure, completion, manipulating items, extracting, or collecting them.
It provides a smooth coding experience, with a navigable API, and the result does not require too much knowledge around reactive.

[source, java]
----
httpCall
    .onFailure().recoverWithItem("my fallback");
----

You may wonder about Reactive Streams (https://www.reactive-streams.org/).
`Multi` implements Reactive Streams `Publisher`, and so implements the Reactive Streams back-pressure mechanism.
`Uni` does not implement `Publisher` as the subscription to the `Uni` is enough to indicate you are interested in the result.
It is again with the idea of simpler and smoother APIs in mind as the Reactive Streams subscription/request ceremony is more complex.

Embracing the unification of reactive and imperative pillars from Quarkus, both `Uni` and `Multi` provide bridges to imperative constructs.
For example, you can transform a `Multi` into an `Iterable` or _await_ the item produced by a `Uni`.

[source, java]
----
// Block until the result is available
String result = uni.await().indefinitely();

// Transform an asynchronous stream into a blocking iterable
stream.subscribe().asIterable().forEach(s -> System.out.println("Item is " + s));
----

At that point, if you are a RxJava or a Reactor user, you may wonder how you can use your familiar `Flowable`, `Single`, `Flux`, `Mono`...
Mutiny allows converting `Unis` and `Multis` from and to RX Java and Reactor types:

[source, java]
----
Maybe<String> maybe = uni.convert().with(UniRxConverters.toMaybe());
Flux<String> flux = multi.convert().with(MultiReactorConverters.toFlux());
----

But, what about Vert.x?
Vert.x APIs are also available using Mutiny types.
The following snippet shows a usage of the Vert.x Web Client:

[source, java]
----
// Use io.vertx.mutiny.ext.web.client.WebClient
client = WebClient.create(vertx,
                new WebClientOptions().setDefaultHost("fruityvice.com").setDefaultPort(443).setSsl(true)
                        .setTrustAll(true));
// ...
Uni<JsonObject> uni =
    client.get("/api/fruit/" + name)
        .send()
        .onItem().transform(resp -> {
            if (resp.statusCode() == 200) {
                return resp.bodyAsJsonObject();
            } else {
                return new JsonObject()
                        .put("code", resp.statusCode())
                        .put("message", resp.bodyAsString());
            }
        });
----

Last but not least, Mutiny has built-in integration with SmallRye Context Propagation so you can propagate transactions, traceability data, and so on in your reactive pipeline.

But enough talking, let's get our hands dirty!

== Bootstrapping the project

There are several ways to implement reactive application with Quarkus.
In this guide we are going to use RESTEasy Reactive, an implementation of RESTEasy benefiting from the Quarkus reactive engine.
By default, it invokes the HTTP endpoint on the I/O thread.

IMPORTANT: While it's possible to use _traditional_ RESTEasy, you would need to add the `quarkus-resteasy-mutiny` extension, and the method will still be invoked on a _worker_ thread.
So, while it would use reactive programming, it would still require worker threads, which defeats the purpose.

The easiest way to create a new Quarkus project is to open a terminal and run the following command:

For Linux and macOS users

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=getting-started-reactive \
    -DclassName="org.acme.getting.started.ReactiveGreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="resteasy-reactive"
cd getting-started-reactive
----

For Windows users

- If using cmd, (don't use forward slash `\`)

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create -DprojectGroupId=org.acme -DprojectArtifactId=getting-started-reactive -DclassName="org.acme.getting.started.ReactiveGreetingResource" -Dpath="/hello" -Dextensions="resteasy-reactive"
----

- If using Powershell, wrap `-D` parameters in double quotes

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create "-DprojectGroupId=org.acme" "-DprojectArtifactId=getting-started-reactive" "-DclassName=org.acme.getting.started.ReactiveGreetingResource" "-Dpath=/hello" "-Dextensions=resteasy-reactive"
----

It generates the following in  `./getting-started-reactive`:

* the Maven structure
* an `org.acme.quickstart.ReactiveGreetingResource` resource exposed on `/hello`
* an associated unit test
* a landing page that is accessible on `http://localhost:8080` after starting the application
* example `Dockerfile` files for both `native` and `jvm` modes in `src/main/docker`
* the application configuration file

=== Reactive JAX-RS resources

During the project creation, the `src/main/java/org/acme/getting/started/ReactiveGreetingResource.java` file has been created with the following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.getting.started;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class ReactiveGreetingResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello RESTEasy Reactive";
    }
}
----

It's a very simple REST endpoint, returning "Hello RESTEasy Reactive" to requests on "/hello".
As it uses RESTEAsy Reactive, this method is called on the I/O thread.

[NOTE]
====
To instruct Quarkus to invoke this method on a _worker_ thread, annotate it with the `io.smallrye.common.annotation.Blocking` annotation.
You can use `@Blocking` on a method, class or enable it for the whole application by annotated an `Application` class:

[source, java]
----
import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import io.smallrye.common.annotation.Blocking;

@ApplicationPath("/")
@Blocking
public class RestBlockingApplication extends Application {
}
----
====

Let's now create a `ReactiveGreetingService` class with the following content:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme.getting.started;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import java.time.Duration;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ReactiveGreetingService {

    public Uni<String> greeting(String name) {
        return Uni.createFrom().item(name)
                .onItem().transform(n -> String.format("hello %s", n));
    }
}
----

Then, edit the `ReactiveGreetingResource` class to match the following content:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme.getting.started;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

@Path("/hello")
public class ReactiveGreetingResource {

    @Inject
    ReactiveGreetingService service;

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    @Path("/greeting/{name}")
    public Uni<String> greeting(String name) {
        return service.greeting(name);
    }

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }
}
----

The `ReactiveGreetingService` class contains a straightforward method producing a `Uni`.
While, in this example, the resulting item is emitted immediately, you can imagine any async API producing a `Uni`.
We cover this later in this guide.

Now, start the application using:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

Once running, check you get the expected greeting message by opening http://localhost:8080/hello/greeting/neo.

== Handling streams
So far, we only return an asynchronous result.
In this section, we extend the application with streams conveying multiple items.
These streams could come from Kafka or any other source of data, but to keep things simple, we just generate periodic greeting messages.

In the `ReactiveGreetingService`, add the following method:

[source, java]
----
public Multi<String> greetings(int count, String name) {
  return Multi.createFrom().ticks().every(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
        .onItem().transform(n -> String.format("hello %s - %d", name, n))
        .select().first(count);
}
----

TIP: you may need to add the `import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;` and `import java.time.Duration;` statements.

It generates a greeting message every second and stops after `count` messages.

In the `ReactiveGreetingResource` add the following method:

[source, java]
----
@GET
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Path("/greeting/{count}/{name}")
public Multi<String> greetings(int count, String name) {
  return service.greetings(count, name);
}
----

This endpoint streams the items to the client as a JSON Array.
The name and number of messages are parameterized using path parameters.

So calling the endpoint produces something like:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello/greeting/3/neo
["hello neo - 0", "hello neo - 1", "hello neo - 2"]
----

We can also generate Server-Sent Event responses by returning a `Multi`:

[source, java]
----
@GET
@Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
@RestSseElementType(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
@Path("/stream/{count}/{name}")
public Multi<String> greetingsAsStream(int count, String name) {
    return service.greetings(count, name);
}
----

The only difference with the previous snippet is the produced type and the `@RestSseElementType` annotation indicating the type of each event.
As the `@Produces` annotation defines `SERVER_SENT_EVENTS`, JAX-RS needs it to knows the content type of each (nested) event.

TIP: You may need to add the `import org.jboss.resteasy.reactive.RestSseElementType;` statement.

You can see the result using:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -N http://localhost:8080/hello/stream/5/neo
data: hello neo - 0

data: hello neo - 1

data: hello neo - 2

data: hello neo - 3

data: hello neo - 4
----

== Using Reactive APIs

=== Using Quarkus reactive APIs

Quarkus provides many reactive APIs using the Mutiny model.
In this section, we are going to see how you can use the Reactive PostgreSQL driver to interact with your database in a non-blocking and reactive way.

Create a new project using:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=getting-started-reactive-crud \
    -DclassName="org.acme.reactive.crud.FruitResource" \
    -Dpath="/fruits" \
    -Dextensions="resteasy-reactive,resteasy-reactive-jackson,reactive-pg-client"
cd getting-started-reactive-crud
----

This application is interacting with a PostgreSQL database, so you need one:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 -it --rm=true --memory-swappiness=0 \
           --name postgres-quarkus-reactive -e POSTGRES_USER=quarkus_test \
           -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=quarkus_test -e POSTGRES_DB=quarkus_test \
           -p 5432:5432 postgres:11.2
----

Then, let's configure our datasource.
Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` and add the following content:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql
quarkus.datasource.username=quarkus_test
quarkus.datasource.password=quarkus_test
quarkus.datasource.reactive.url=postgresql://localhost:5432/quarkus_test
myapp.schema.create=true
----

The 3 first lines define the datasource.
The last line is going to be used in the application to indicate whether we insert a few items when the application gets initialized.

Now, let's create our _entity_.
Create the `org.acme.reactive.crud.Fruit` class with the following content:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme.reactive.crud;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import io.vertx.mutiny.pgclient.PgPool;
import io.vertx.mutiny.sqlclient.Row;
import io.vertx.mutiny.sqlclient.RowSet;
import io.vertx.mutiny.sqlclient.Tuple;

import java.util.stream.StreamSupport;

public class Fruit {

    public Long id;

    public String name;

    public Fruit() {
        // default constructor.
    }

    public Fruit(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Fruit(Long id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public static Multi<Fruit> findAll(PgPool client) {
        return client.query("SELECT id, name FROM fruits ORDER BY name ASC").execute()
                // Create a Multi from the set of rows:
                .onItem().transformToMulti(set -> Multi.createFrom().items(() -> StreamSupport.stream(set.spliterator(), false)))
                // For each row create a fruit instance
                .onItem().transform(Fruit::from);
    }

    public static Uni<Fruit> findById(PgPool client, Long id) {
        return client.preparedQuery("SELECT id, name FROM fruits WHERE id = $1").execute(Tuple.of(id))
                .onItem().transform(RowSet::iterator)
                .onItem().transform(iterator -> iterator.hasNext() ? from(iterator.next()) : null);
    }

    public Uni<Long> save(PgPool client) {
        return client.preparedQuery("INSERT INTO fruits (name) VALUES ($1) RETURNING (id)").execute(Tuple.of(name))
                .onItem().transform(pgRowSet -> pgRowSet.iterator().next().getLong("id"));
    }

    public Uni<Boolean> update(PgPool client) {
        return client.preparedQuery("UPDATE fruits SET name = $1 WHERE id = $2").execute(Tuple.of(name, id))
                .onItem().transform(pgRowSet -> pgRowSet.rowCount() == 1);
    }

    public static Uni<Boolean> delete(PgPool client, Long id) {
        return client.preparedQuery("DELETE FROM fruits WHERE id = $1").execute(Tuple.of(id))
                .onItem().transform(pgRowSet -> pgRowSet.rowCount() == 1);
    }

    private static Fruit from(Row row) {
        return new Fruit(row.getLong("id"), row.getString("name"));
    }
}
----

This _entity_ contains a few fields and methods to find, update, and delete rows from the database.
These methods return either `Unis` or `Multis` as the produced items are emitted asynchronously when the results have been retrieved.
Notice that the reactive PostgreSQL client already provides `Uni` and `Multi` instances.
So you only transform the results from the database into _business-friendly_ objects.

For the purposes of initializing the database when the application starts, we will create a class named `DBInit` with the following content:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme.reactive.crud;

import io.quarkus.runtime.StartupEvent;
import io.vertx.mutiny.pgclient.PgPool;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;

@ApplicationScoped
public class DBInit {

    private final PgPool client;
    private final boolean schemaCreate;

    public DBInit(PgPool client, @ConfigProperty(name = "myapp.schema.create", defaultValue = "true") boolean schemaCreate) {
        this.client = client;
        this.schemaCreate = schemaCreate;
    }

    void onStart(@Observes StartupEvent ev) {
        if (schemaCreate) {
            initdb();
        }
    }

    private void initdb() {
        client.query("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS fruits").execute()
                .flatMap(r -> client.query("CREATE TABLE fruits (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL)").execute())
                .flatMap(r -> client.query("INSERT INTO fruits (name) VALUES ('Kiwi')").execute())
                .flatMap(r -> client.query("INSERT INTO fruits (name) VALUES ('Durian')").execute())
                .flatMap(r -> client.query("INSERT INTO fruits (name) VALUES ('Pomelo')").execute())
                .flatMap(r -> client.query("INSERT INTO fruits (name) VALUES ('Lychee')").execute())
                .await().indefinitely();
    }
}
----

Then, let's use this `Fruit` class in the `FruitResource`.
Edit the `FruitResource` class to match the following content:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme.reactive.crud;

import java.net.URI;

import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;
import javax.ws.rs.DELETE;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.PUT;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response.ResponseBuilder;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Multi;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import io.vertx.mutiny.pgclient.PgPool;

@Path("fruits")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class FruitResource {

    private final PgPool client;

    public FruitResource(PgPool client) {
        this.client = client;
    }

    @GET
    public Multi<Fruit> get() {
        return Fruit.findAll(client);
    }

    @GET
    @Path("{id}")
    public Uni<Response> getSingle(Long id) {
        return Fruit.findById(client, id)
                .onItem().transform(fruit -> fruit != null ? Response.ok(fruit) : Response.status(Status.NOT_FOUND))
                .onItem().transform(ResponseBuilder::build);
    }

    @POST
    public Uni<Response> create(Fruit fruit) {
        return fruit.save(client)
                .onItem().transform(id -> URI.create("/fruits/" + id))
                .onItem().transform(uri -> Response.created(uri).build());
    }

    @PUT
    @Path("{id}")
    public Uni<Response> update(Long id, Fruit fruit) {
        return fruit.update(client)
                .onItem().transform(updated -> updated ? Status.OK : Status.NOT_FOUND)
                .onItem().transform(status -> Response.status(status).build());
    }

    @DELETE
    @Path("{id}")
    public Uni<Response> delete(Long id) {
        return Fruit.delete(client, id)
                .onItem().transform(deleted -> deleted ? Status.NO_CONTENT : Status.NOT_FOUND)
                .onItem().transform(status -> Response.status(status).build());
    }
}
----

This resource returns `Uni` and `Multi` instances based on the result produced by the `Fruit` class.

=== Using Vert.x clients

The previous example uses a _service_ provided by Quarkus.
Also, you can use Vert.x clients directly.

First of all, make sure the `quarkus-vertx` extension is present. If not, activate the extension by executing the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:add-extensions \
    -Dextensions=vertx
----

Or add `quarkus-vertx` into your dependencies manually.

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
	<artifactId>quarkus-vertx</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There is a Mutiny version of the Vert.x APIs.
This API is divided into several artifacts you can import independently:

|===
|groupId:artifactId | Description

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-core`
|Mutiny API for Vert.x Core

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-mail-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x Mail Client

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-web-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x Web Client

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-mongo-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x Mongo Client

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-redis-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x Redis Client

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-cassandra-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x Cassandra Client

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-consul-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x Consul Client

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-kafka-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x Kafka Client

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-amqp-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x AMQP Client

|`io.smallrye.reactive:smallrye-mutiny-vertx-rabbitmq-client`
|Mutiny API for the Vert.x RabbitMQ Client
|===

You can also check the available APIs on http://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-utils/apidocs/.

Let's take an example.
Add the following dependency to your application:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
    <artifactId>smallrye-mutiny-vertx-web-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

It provides the Mutiny API of the Vert.x Web Client.
Then, you can use the web client as follows:

[source, java]

There are 2 important points:

1. The injected Vert.x instance has the `io.vertx.mutiny.core.Vertx` type which is the Mutiny variant of Vert.x;
2. The Web Client is created from `io.vertx.mutiny.ext.web.client.WebClient`.

The Mutiny version of the Vert.x APIs also offers:

* `andAwait` methods such as `sendAndAwait`. `andAwait` indicates that the caller thread is blocked until the result is available.
Be aware not to block the event loop / IO thread that way.
* `andForget` methods such as `writeAndForget`. `andForget` is available for method returning a `Uni`.
`andForget` indicates that you don't need the resulting `Uni` indicating the success or failure of the operation.
However, remember that if you don't subscribe, the operation would not be triggered.
`andForget` manages this for you and manage the subscription.
* `toMulti` methods allowing to transform a Vert.x `ReadStream` into a `Multi`
* `toBlockingIterable` / `toBlockingStream` methods allowing to transform a Vert.x `ReadStream` into a blocking iterable or blocking `java.util.Stream`

=== Using RxJava or Reactor APIs

Mutiny provides utilities to convert RxJava 2 and Project Reactor types to `Uni` and `Multi`.

RxJava 2 converters are available in the following dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
    <artifactId>mutiny-rxjava</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

So if you have an API returning RxJava 2 types (`Completable`, `Single`, `Maybe`, `Observable`, `Flowable`), you can create `Unis` and `Multis` as follows:

[source, java]
----
import io.smallrye.mutiny.converters.multi.MultiRxConverters;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.converters.uni.UniRxConverters;
// ...
Uni<Void> uniFromCompletable = Uni.createFrom().converter(UniRxConverters.fromCompletable(), completable);
Uni<String> uniFromSingle = Uni.createFrom().converter(UniRxConverters.fromSingle(), single);
Uni<String> uniFromMaybe = Uni.createFrom().converter(UniRxConverters.fromMaybe(), maybe);
Uni<String> uniFromEmptyMaybe = Uni.createFrom().converter(UniRxConverters.fromMaybe(), emptyMaybe);
Uni<String> uniFromObservable = Uni.createFrom().converter(UniRxConverters.fromObservable(), observable);
Uni<String> uniFromFlowable = Uni.createFrom().converter(UniRxConverters.fromFlowable(), flowable);

Multi<Void> multiFromCompletable = Multi.createFrom().converter(MultiRxConverters.fromCompletable(), completable);
Multi<String> multiFromSingle = Multi.createFrom().converter(MultiRxConverters.fromSingle(), single);
Multi<String> multiFromMaybe = Multi.createFrom().converter(MultiRxConverters.fromMaybe(), maybe);
Multi<String> multiFromEmptyMaybe = Multi.createFrom().converter(MultiRxConverters.fromMaybe(), emptyMaybe);
Multi<String> multiFromObservable = Multi.createFrom().converter(MultiRxConverters.fromObservable(), observable);
Multi<String> multiFromFlowable = Multi.createFrom().converter(MultiRxConverters.fromFlowable(), flowable);
----

You can also transform `Unis` and `Multis` into RxJava types:

[source, java]
----
Completable completable = uni.convert().with(UniRxConverters.toCompletable());
Single<Optional<String>> single = uni.convert().with(UniRxConverters.toSingle());
Single<String> single2 = uni.convert().with(UniRxConverters.toSingle().failOnNull());
Maybe<String> maybe = uni.convert().with(UniRxConverters.toMaybe());
Observable<String> observable = uni.convert().with(UniRxConverters.toObservable());
Flowable<String> flowable = uni.convert().with(UniRxConverters.toFlowable());
// ...
Completable completable = multi.convert().with(MultiRxConverters.toCompletable());
Single<Optional<String>> single = multi.convert().with(MultiRxConverters.toSingle());
Single<String> single2 = multi.convert().with(MultiRxConverters
        .toSingle().onEmptyThrow(() -> new Exception("D'oh!")));
Maybe<String> maybe = multi.convert().with(MultiRxConverters.toMaybe());
Observable<String> observable = multi.convert().with(MultiRxConverters.toObservable());
Flowable<String> flowable = multi.convert().with(MultiRxConverters.toFlowable());
----

Project Reactor converters are available in the following dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
    <artifactId>mutiny-reactor</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

So if you have an API returning Reactor types (`Mono`, `Flux`), you can create `Unis` and `Multis` as follows:

[source, java]
----
import io.smallrye.mutiny.converters.multi.MultiReactorConverters;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.converters.uni.UniReactorConverters;
// ...
Uni<String> uniFromMono = Uni.createFrom().converter(UniReactorConverters.fromMono(), mono);
Uni<String> uniFromFlux = Uni.createFrom().converter(UniReactorConverters.fromFlux(), flux);

Multi<String> multiFromMono = Multi.createFrom().converter(MultiReactorConverters.fromMono(), mono);
Multi<String> multiFromFlux = Multi.createFrom().converter(MultiReactorConverters.fromFlux(), flux);
----

You can also transform `Unis` and `Multis` into Reactor types:

[source, java]
----
Mono<String> mono = uni.convert().with(UniReactorConverters.toMono());
Flux<String> flux = uni.convert().with(UniReactorConverters.toFlux());

Mono<String> mono2 = multi.convert().with(MultiReactorConverters.toMono());
Flux<String> flux2 = multi.convert().with(MultiReactorConverters.toFlux());
----

=== Using CompletionStages or Publisher API

If you are facing an API using `CompletionStage`, `CompletableFuture`, or `Publisher`, you can convert back and forth.
First, both `Uni` and `Multi` can be created from a `CompletionStage` or from a `Supplier<CompletionStage>`. For example:

[source, java]
----
CompletableFuture<String> future = Uni
        // Create from a Completion Stage
        .createFrom().completionStage(CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "hello"));
----

On `Uni`, you can also produce a `CompletionStage` using `subscribeAsCompletionStage()` that produces a `CompletionStage` that would get the item or failure emitted by the `Uni`.

You can also create `Unis` and `Multis` from instances of `Publisher` using `createFrom().publisher(Publisher)`.
You can transform a `Uni` into a `Publisher` using `toMulti`.
Indeed, `Multi` implements `Publisher`.
