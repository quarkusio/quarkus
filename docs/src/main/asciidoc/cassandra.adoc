= Quarkus - Using the Cassandra Client

include::./attributes.adoc[]

Apache Cassandra® is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database
management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing
high availability with no single point of failure.

In this guide, we will see how you can get your REST services to use a Cassandra database.

include::./platform-include.adoc[]

== Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart guide, you need:

* an IDE;
* JDK 11+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately;
* link:https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] installed with the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable
configured appropriately, if you want to
link:https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image[use the native mode];
* Apache Maven {maven-version} 
* A running link:https://cassandra.apache.org[Apache Cassandra],
link:https://www.datastax.fr/products/datastax-enterprise[DataStax Enterprise] (DSE) or
link:https://astra.datastax.com[DataStax Astra] database; or alternatively, a fresh Docker
installation.

== Architecture

This quickstart guide shows how to build a REST application using the
link:https://github.com/datastax/cassandra-quarkus[Cassandra Quarkus extension], which allows you to
connect to an Apache Cassandra, DataStax Enterprise (DSE) or DataStax Astra database, using the
link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest[DataStax Java driver].

This guide will also use the
link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/manual/mapper[DataStax Object Mapper]
– a powerful Java-to-CQL mapping framework that greatly simplifies your application's data access
layer code by sparing you the hassle of writing your CQL queries by hand.

The application built in this quickstart guide is quite simple: the user can add elements in a list
using a form, and the items list is updated. All the information between the browser and the server
is formatted as JSON, and the elements are stored in the Cassandra database.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step
by step. However, you can go right to the completed example.

The solution is located in the
link:https://github.com/datastax/cassandra-quarkus/tree/master/quickstart[quickstart directory] of
the Cassandra Quarkus extension GitHub repository.

== Creating a Blank Maven Project

First, create a new Maven project and copy the `pom.xml` file that is present in the `quickstart`
directory.

The `pom.xml` is importing all the Quarkus extensions and dependencies you need.

== Creating the Data Model and Data Access Objects

In this example, we will create an application to manage a list of fruits.

First, let's create our data model – represented by the `Fruit` class – as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@PropertyStrategy(mutable = false)
public class Fruit {

    @PartitionKey
    private final String name;

    private final String description;

    public Fruit(String name, String description) {
      this.name = name;
      this.description = description;
    }
  // getters, hashCode, equals, toString methods omitted for brevity
}
----

As stated above, we are using the DataStax Object Mapper. In other words, we are not going to write
our CQL queries manually; instead, we will annotate our data model with a few annotations, and the
mapper will generate proper CQL queries underneath.

This is why the `Fruit` class is annotated with `@Entity`: this annotation marks it as an _entity
class_ that is mapped to a Cassandra table. Its instances are meant to be automatically persisted
into, and retrieved from, the Cassandra database. Here, the table name will be inferred from the
class name: `fruit`.

Also, the `name` field represents a Cassandra partition key, and so we are annotating it with
`@PartitionKey` – another annotation from the Object Mapper library.

IMPORTANT: Entity classes are normally required to have a default no-arg constructor, unless they
are annotated with `@PropertyStrategy(mutable = false)`, which is the case here.

The next step is to create a DAO (Data Access Object) interface that will manage instances of
`Fruit` entities:

[source,java]
----
@Dao
public interface FruitDao {
  @Update
  void update(Fruit fruit);

  @Select
  PagingIterable<Fruit> findAll();
}
----

This interface exposes operations that will be used in our REST service. Again, the annotation
`@Dao` comes from the DataStax Object Mapper, which will also automatically generate an
implementation of this interface for you.

Note also the special return type of the `findAll` method,
link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/latest/com/datastax/oss/driver/api/core/PagingIterable.html[`PagingIterable`]:
it's the base type of result sets returned by the driver.

Finally, let's create the a Mapper interface:

[source,java]
----
@Mapper
public interface FruitMapper {
  @DaoFactory
  FruitDao fruitDao();
}
----

The `@Mapper` annotation is yet another annotation recognized by the DataStax Object Mapper. A
mapper is responsible for constructing instances of DAOs – in this case, out mapper is constructing
an instance of our only DAO, `FruitDao`.

== Creating a Service & JSON REST Endpoint

Now let's create a `FruitService` that will be the business layer of our application and store/load
the fruits from the Cassandra database.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class FruitService {

  @Inject FruitDao dao;

  public void save(Fruit fruit) {
    dao.update(fruit);
  }

  public List<Fruit> getAll() {
    return dao.findAll().all();
  }
}
----

Note how the service is being injected a `FruitDao` instance. This DAO instance is injected
automatically.

The Cassandra Quarkus extension allows you to inject any of the following beans in your own
components:

- All `@Mapper`-annotated interfaces in your project.
- All `@Dao`-annotated interfaces in your project, as long as they are produced by a corresponding
`@DaoFactory`-annotated method declared in a mapper interface from your project.
- The
link:https://javadoc.io/doc/com.datastax.oss.quarkus/cassandra-quarkus-client/latest/com/datastax/oss/quarkus/runtime/api/session/QuarkusCqlSession.html[`QuarkusCqlSession`]
bean: this application-scoped, singleton bean is your main entry point to the Cassandra client; it
is a specialized Cassandra driver session instance with a few methods tailored especially for
Quarkus. Read its javadocs carefully!

In our example, both `FruitMapper` and `FruitDao` could be injected anywhere. We chose to inject
`FruitDao` in `FruitService`.

The last missing piece is the REST API that will expose GET and POST methods:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/fruits")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class FruitResource {

  @Inject FruitService fruitService;

  @GET
  public List<FruitDto> getAll() {
    return fruitService.getAll().stream().map(this::convertToDto).collect(Collectors.toList());
  }

  @POST
  public void add(FruitDto fruit) {
    fruitService.save(convertFromDto(fruit));
  }

  private FruitDto convertToDto(Fruit fruit) {
    return new FruitDto(fruit.getName(), fruit.getDescription());
  }

  private Fruit convertFromDto(FruitDto fruitDto) {
    return new Fruit(fruitDto.getName(), fruitDto.getDescription());
  }
}
----

Notice how `FruitResource` is being injected a `FruitService` instance automatically.

It is generally not recommended using the same entity object between the REST API and the data
access layer. These layers should indeed be decoupled and use distinct APIs in order to allow each
API to evolve independently of the other. This is the reason why our REST API is using a different
object: the `FruitDto` class – the word DTO stands for "Data Transfer Object". This DTO object will
be automatically converted to and from JSON in HTTP messages:

[source,java]
----
public class FruitDto {

  private String name;
  private String description;

  public FruitDto() {}

  public FruitDto(String name, String description) {
    this.name = name;
    this.description = description;
  }
  // getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
----

The translation to and from JSON is done automatically by the Quarkus RestEasy extension, which is
included in this guide's pom.xml file. If you want to add it manually to your application, add the
below snippet to your application's ppm.xml file:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy-jsonb</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

IMPORTANT: DTO classes used by the JSON serialization layer are required to have a default no-arg
constructor.

The conversion from DTO to JSON is handled automatically for us, but we still must convert from
`Fruit` to `FruitDto` and vice versa. This must be done manually, which is why we have two
conversion methods declared in `FruitResource`: `convertToDto` and `convertFromDto`.

TIP: In our example, `Fruit` and `FruitDto` are very similar, so you might wonder why not use
`Fruit` everywhere. In real life cases though, it's not uncommon to see DTOs and entities having
very different structures.

== Connecting to the Cassandra Database

=== Connecting to Apache Cassandra or DataStax Enterprise (DSE)

The main properties to configure are: `contact-points`, to access the Cassandra database;
`local-datacenter`, which is required by the driver; and – optionally – the keyspace to bind to.

A sample configuration should look like this:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.cassandra.contact-points={cassandra_ip}:9042
quarkus.cassandra.local-datacenter={dc_name}
quarkus.cassandra.keyspace={keyspace}
----

In this example, we are using a single instance running on localhost, and the keyspace containing
our data is `k1`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.cassandra.contact-points=127.0.0.1:9042
quarkus.cassandra.local-datacenter=datacenter1
quarkus.cassandra.keyspace=k1
----

If your cluster requires plain text authentication, you must also provide two more settings:
`username` and `password`.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.cassandra.auth.username=john
quarkus.cassandra.auth.password=s3cr3t
----

=== Connecting to a DataStax Astra Cloud Database

When connecting to link:https://astra.datastax.com[DataStax Astra], instead of providing a contact
point and a datacenter, you should provide a so-called _secure connect bundle_, which should point
to a valid path to an Astra secure connect bundle file. You can download your secure connect bundle
from the Astra web console.

You will also need to provide a username and password, since authentication is always required on
Astra clusters.

A sample configuration for DataStax Astra should look like this:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.cassandra.cloud.secure-connect-bundle=/path/to/secure-connect-bundle.zip
quarkus.cassandra.auth.username=john
quarkus.cassandra.auth.password=s3cr3t
quarkus.cassandra.keyspace=k1
----

=== Advanced Driver Configuration

You can configure other Java driver settings using `application.conf` or `application.json` files.
They need to be located in the classpath of your application. All settings will be passed
automatically to the underlying driver configuration mechanism. Settings defined in
`application.properties` with the `quarkus.cassandra` prefix will have priority over settings
defined in `application.conf` or `application.json`.

To see the full list of settings, please refer to the
link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/manual/core/configuration/reference/[driver
settings reference].

== Running a Local Cassandra Database

By default, the Cassandra client is configured to access a local Cassandra database on port 9042
(the default Cassandra port).

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the setting `quarkus.cassandra.local-datacenter` matches the datacenter of
your Cassandra cluster.

TIP: If you don't know the name of your local datacenter, this value can be found by running the
following CQL query: `SELECT data_center FROM system.local`.

If you want to use Docker to run a Cassandra database, you can use the following command to launch
one in the background:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --name local-cassandra-instance -p 9042:9042 -d cassandra
----

Next you need to create the keyspace and table that will be used by your application. If you are
using Docker, run the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh -e "CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS k1 WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1}"
docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh -e "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS k1.fruit(name text PRIMARY KEY, description text)"
----

You can also use the CQLSH utility to interactively interrogate your database:

[source,shell]
----
docker exec -it local-cassandra-instance cqlsh
----

== Testing the REST API

In the project root directory:

- Run `mvn clean package` and then `java -jar ./target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-*-runner.jar` to start the application;
- Or better yet, run the application in dev mode: `mvn clean quarkus:dev`.

Now you can use curl commands to interact with the underlying REST API.

To create a fruit:

[source,shell]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"name":"apple","description":"red and tasty"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/fruits
----

To retrieve fruits:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/fruits
----

== Creating a Frontend

Now let's add a simple web page to interact with our `FruitResource`.

Quarkus automatically serves static resources located under the `META-INF/resources` directory. In
the `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` directory, add a `fruits.html` file with the contents
from link:src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/fruits.html[this file] in it.

You can now interact with your REST service:

* If you haven't done yet, start your application with `mvn clean quarkus:dev`;
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/fruits.html`;
* Add new fruits to the list via the form.

[[reactive]]
== Reactive Programming with the Cassandra Client

The
link:https://javadoc.io/doc/com.datastax.oss.quarkus/cassandra-quarkus-client/latest/com/datastax/oss/quarkus/runtime/api/session/QuarkusCqlSession.html[`QuarkusCqlSession`
interface] gives you access to a series of reactive methods that integrate seamlessly with Quarkus
and its reactive framework, Mutiny.

TIP:  If you are not familiar with Mutiny, please check xref:mutiny-primer.adoc[Mutiny - an intuitive reactive programming library].

Let's rewrite our application using reactive programming with Mutiny.

First, let's to declare another DAO interface that works in a reactive way:

[source,java]
----
@Dao
public interface ReactiveFruitDao {

  @Update
  Uni<Void> updateAsync(Fruit fruit);

  @Select
  MutinyMappedReactiveResultSet<Fruit> findAll();
}

----

Note the usage of `MutinyMappedReactiveResultSet` - it is a specialized `Mutiny` type converted from
the original `Publisher` returned by the driver, which also exposes a few extra methods, e.g. to
obtain the query execution info. If you don't need anything in that interface, you can also simply
declare your method to return `Multi`: `Multi<Fruit> findAll()`,

Similarly, the method `updateAsync` returns a `Uni` - it is automatically converted from the
original result set returned by the driver.

NOTE: The Cassandra driver uses the Reactive Streams `Publisher` API for reactive calls. The Quarkus
framework however uses Mutiny. Because of that, the `CqlQuarkusSession` interface transparently
converts the `Publisher` instances returned by the driver into the reactive type `Multi`.
`CqlQuarkusSession` is also capable of converting a `Publisher` into a `Uni` – in this case, the
publisher is expected to emit at most one row, then complete. This is suitable for write queries
(they return no rows), or for read queries guaranteed to return one row at most (count queries, for
example).

Next, we need to adapt the `FruitMapper` to construct a `ReactiveFruitDao` instance:

[source,java]
----
@Mapper
public interface FruitMapper {
  // the existing method omitted

  @DaoFactory
  ReactiveFruitDao reactiveFruitDao();
}

----

Now, we can create a `ReactiveFruitService` that leverages our reactive DAO:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class ReactiveFruitService {

  @Inject ReactiveFruitDao fruitDao;

  public Uni<Void> add(Fruit fruit) {
    return fruitDao.update(fruit);
  }

  public Multi<Fruit> getAll() {
    return fruitDao.findAll();
  }
}
----

Finally, we can create a `ReactiveFruitResource`:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/reactive-fruits")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class ReactiveFruitResource {

  @Inject ReactiveFruitService service;

  @GET
  public Multi<FruitDto> getAll() {
    return service.getAll().map(this::convertToDto);
  }

  @POST
  public Uni<Void> add(FruitDto fruitDto) {
    return service.add(convertFromDto(fruitDto));
  }

  private FruitDto convertToDto(Fruit fruit) {
    return new FruitDto(fruit.getName(), fruit.getDescription());
  }

  private Fruit convertFromDto(FruitDto fruitDto) {
    return new Fruit(fruitDto.getName(), fruitDto.getDescription());
  }
}
----

The above resource is exposing a new endpoint, `reactive-fruits`. Its capabilities are identical to
the ones that we created before with `FruitResource`, but everything is handled in a reactive
fashion, without any blocking operation.

NOTE: The `getAll()` method above returns `Multi`, and the `add()` method returns `Uni`. These types
are the same Mutiny types that we met before; they are automatically recognized by the Quarkus
reactive REST API, so we don't need to convert them into JSON ourselves.

To effectively integrate the reactive logic with the REST API, your application needs to declare a
dependency to the Quarkus RestEasy Mutiny extension:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy-mutiny</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This dependency is already included in this guide's pom.xml, but if you are starting a new project
from scratch, make sure to include it.

== Testing the Reactive REST API

Run the application in dev mode as explained above, then you can use curl commands to interact with
the underlying REST API.

To create a fruit using the reactive REST endpoint:

[source,shell]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"name":"banana","description":"yellow and sweet"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits
----

To retrieve fruits with the reactive REST endpoint:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits
----

== Creating a Reactive Frontend

Now let's add a simple web page to interact with our `ReactiveFruitResource`. In the
`src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` directory, add a `reactive-fruits.html` file with the
contents from link:src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/reactive-fruits.html[this file] in it.

You can now interact with your reactive REST service:

* If you haven't done yet, start your application with `mvn clean quarkus:dev`;
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/reactive-fruits.html`;
* Add new fruits to the list via the form.

== Health Checks

If you are using the Quarkus SmallRye Health extension, then the Cassandra client will automatically
add a readiness health check to validate the connection to the Cassandra cluster. This extension is
already included in this guide's pom.xml, but if you need to include it manually in your
application, add the following:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-health</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

When health checks are available, you can access the `/health/ready` endpoint of your application
and have information about the connection validation status.

Running in dev mode with `mvn clean quarkus:dev`, if you point your browser to
http://localhost:8080/health/ready you should see an output similar to the following one:

[source,text]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "DataStax Apache Cassandra Driver health check",
            "status": "UP",
            "data": {
                "cqlVersion": "3.4.4",
                "releaseVersion": "3.11.7",
                "clusterName": "Test Cluster",
                "datacenter": "datacenter1",
                "numberOfNodes": 1
            }
        }
    ]
}
----

TIP: If you need health checks globally enabled in your application, but don't want to activate
Cassandra health checks, you can disable Cassandra health checks by setting the
`quarkus.cassandra.health.enabled` property to `false` in your `application.properties`.

== Metrics

The Cassandra Quarkus client can provide metrics about the Cassandra session and about individual
Cassandra nodes. It supports both Micrometer and MicroProfile.

The first step to enable metrics is to add a few additional dependencies depending on the metrics
framework you plan to use.

=== Enabling Metrics with Micrometer

Micrometer is the recommended metrics framework in Quarkus applications since Quarkus 1.9.

To enable Micrometer metrics in your application, you need to add the following to your pom.xml.

For Quarkus 1.11+:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-metrics-micrometer</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

For Quarkus < 1.11:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-metrics-micrometer</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-micrometer</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
  <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This guide uses Micrometer, so the above dependencies are already included in this guide's pom.xml.

=== Enabling Metrics with MicroProfile Metrics

Remove any dependency to Micrometer from your pom.xml, then add the following ones instead:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.datastax.oss</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-driver-metrics-microprofile</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-metrics</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

=== Enabling Cassandra Metrics

Even when metrics are enabled in your application, the Cassandra client will not report any metrics,
unless you opt-in for this feature. So your next step is to enable Cassandra metrics in your
`application.properties` file.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.cassandra.metrics.enabled=true
----

That's it!

The final (and optional) step is to customize which specific Cassandra metrics you would like the
Cassandra client to track. Several metrics can be tracked; if you skip this step, a default set of
useful metrics will be automatically tracked.

TIP: For the full list of available metric names, please refer to the
link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/manual/core/configuration/reference/[driver
settings reference] page; search for the `advanced.metrics` section.
Also, Cassandra driver metrics are covered in detail in the
https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/latest/manual/core/metrics/[driver manual].

If you do wish to customize which metrics to track, you should use the following properties:

* `quarkus.cassandra.metrics.session.enabled` should contain the session-level metrics to enable
(metrics that are global to the session).
* `quarkus.cassandra.metrics.node.enabled` should contain the node-level metrics to enable (metrics
for which each node contacted by the Cassandra client gets its own metric value).

Both properties accept a comma-separated list of valid metric names.

For example, let's assume that you wish to enable the following three Cassandra metrics:

* Session-level: `session.connected-nodes` and `session.bytes-sent`;
* Node-level: `node.pool.open-connections`.

Then you should add the following settings to your `application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.cassandra.metrics.enabled=true
quarkus.cassandra.metrics.session.enabled=connected-nodes,bytes-sent
quarkus.cassandra.metrics.node.enabled=pool.open-connections
----

This guide's `application.properties` file has already many metrics enabled; you can use its metrics
list as a good starting point for exposing useful Cassandra metrics in your application.

When metrics are properly enabled, metric reports for all enabled metrics are available at the
`/metrics` REST endpoint of your application.

Running in dev mode with `mvn clean quarkus:dev`, if you point your browser to
`http://localhost:8080/metrics` you should see a list of metrics; search for metrics whose names
contain `cassandra`.

IMPORTANT: For Cassandra metrics to show up, the Cassandra client needs to be initialized and
connected; if you are using lazy initialization (see below), you won't see any Cassandra metrics
until your application actually connects and hits the database for the first time.

== Running in native mode

If you installed GraalVM, you can link:https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image[build a
native image] using:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean package -Dnative
----

Beware that native compilation can take a significant amount of time! Once the compilation is done,
you can run the native executable as follows:

[source,shell]
----
./target/cassandra-quarkus-quickstart-*-runner
----

You can then point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/fruits.html` and use your application.

== Eager vs Lazy Initialization

This extension allows you to inject either:

- a `QuarkusCqlSession` bean;
- or the asynchronous version of this bean, that is, `CompletionStage<QuarkusCqlSession>`;
- or the reactive version of this bean, that is, `Uni<QuarkusCqlSession>`.

The most straightforward approach is obviously to inject `QuarkusCqlSession` directly. This should
work just fine for most applications; however, the `QuarkusCqlSession` bean needs to be initialized
before it can be used, and this process is blocking.

Fortunately, it is possible to control when the initialization should happen: the
`quarkus.cassandra.init.eager-init` parameter determines if the `QuarkusCqlSession` bean should be
initialized on its first access (lazy) or when the application is starting (eager). The default
value of this parameter is `false`, meaning the init process is lazy: the `QuarkusCqlSession` bean
will be initialized lazily on its first access – for example, when there is a first REST request
that needs to interact with the Cassandra database.

Using lazy initialization speeds up your application startup time, and avoids startup failures if
the Cassandra database is not available. However, it could also prove dangerous if your code is
fully asynchronous, e.g. if you are using https://quarkus.io/guides/reactive-routes[reactive
routes]: indeed, the lazy initialization could accidentally happen on a thread that is not allowed
to block, such as a Vert.x event loop thread. Therefore, setting `quarkus.cassandra.init.eager-init`
to `false` and injecting `QuarkusCqlSession` should be avoided in these contexts.

If you want to use Vert.x (or any other reactive framework) and keep the lazy initialization
behavior, you should instead inject only `CompletionStage<QuarkusCqlSession>` or
`Uni<QuarkusCqlSession>`. When injecting these beans, the initialization process will be triggered
lazily, but it will happen in the background, in a non-blocking way, leveraging the Vert.x event
loop. This way you don't risk blocking the Vert.x thread.

Alternatively, you can set `quarkus.cassandra.init.eager-init` to true: in this case the session
bean will be initialized eagerly during application startup, on the Quarkus main thread. This would
eliminate any risk of blocking a Vert.x thread, at the cost of making your startup time (much)
longer.

== Conclusion

Accessing a Cassandra database from a client application is easy with Quarkus and the Cassandra
extension, which provides configuration and native support for the DataStax Java driver for Apache
Cassandra.
