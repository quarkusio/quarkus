:summary: An introduction to Dev Services and a list of all extensions that support Dev Services and their configuration options.
:topics: dev-services,dev-mode,testing

== What Are Dev Services?

Quarkus supports the automatic provisioning of unconfigured services in development and test mode. We refer to this capability
as Dev Services. If you include an extension and don't configure it then
Quarkus will automatically start the relevant service (usually using https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers] behind the scenes) and wire up your
application to use this service.

For a tutorial showing how to get started writing an application with persistence and Dev Services, see xref:getting-started-dev-services.adoc[Your Second Quarkus Application].


== Using Dev Services

Dev Services are designed to be frictionless, so they will be automatically started any time you include an extension which supports
Dev Services, as long as you don't configure a connection to an external service.

NOTE: In order to use most Dev Services you will need a working container environment (remote environments are supported).
If you don't have a container environment, such as Docker or Podman, installed you will need to configure your services normally.

The default startup timeout for Dev Services is 60s, if this is not enough you can increase it with the `quarkus.devservices.timeout` property.

To configure a production service but continue to use Dev Services in development and test modes, use xref:config-reference.adoc#default-profiles[configuration profiles].

For example,

[source, properties]
----
# configure your datasource
%prod.quarkus.datasource.db-kind = postgresql
%prod.quarkus.datasource.username = prod-admin
%prod.quarkus.datasource.password = super-secret
%prod.quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
----

== Disabling Dev Services

All this functionality is part of the Quarkus `deployment` modules, so does not affect the production application in any
way. If you want to disable all Dev Services you can use the `quarkus.devservices.enabled=false` config property, although
in most cases this is not necessary as simply configuring the service will result in the Dev Service being disabled automatically.



== Platform Dev Services

This section lists all the Dev Services available in the Quarkus Platform.

=== AMQP

The AMQP Dev Service will be enabled when the `quarkus-messaging-amqp` extension is present in your application, and
the broker address has not been explicitly configured. More information can be found in the
xref:amqp-dev-services.adoc[AMQP Dev Services Guide].

=== Apicurio Registry

The Apicurio Dev Service will be enabled when the `quarkus-apicurio-registry-avro` extension is present in your application, and it's
address has not been explicitly configured. More information can be found in the
xref:apicurio-registry-dev-services.adoc[Apicurio Registry Dev Services Guide].

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-schema-registry-devservice_quarkus.apicurio-registry.devservices.adoc[opts=optional, leveloffset=+1]

=== Databases

The database Dev Services will be enabled when a reactive or JDBC datasource extension is present in the application,
and the database URL has not been configured. More information can be found in the
xref:databases-dev-services.adoc[Databases Dev Services Guide].

Quarkus provides Dev Services for all databases it supports. Most of these are run in a container, except
H2 and Derby which are run in-process. Dev Services are supported for both JDBC and reactive drivers.

Those relational databases that are running in a container are started using Testcontainers and support "reusable instances";
this implies that if you add the property `testcontainers.reuse.enable=true` in your Testcontainers configuration file,
a property file named `.testcontainers.properties` in your user home, then the databases will not be stopped aggressively
after each run, and can be reused.

N.B. if you opt in for this feature, Quarkus will not reset the state of the database between runs unless you explicitly configure it to.

=== WireMock

The WireMock extension starts WireMock as a Dev Service. It is a test-focussed extension, designed to run in dev and test mode only.
More information can be found in the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-wiremock/dev/index.html[WireMock Guide].

=== Microcks

The Microcks Quarkus extension includes a Microcks Dev Service. The Dev Service manages mocks for dependencies and contract-testing your API endpoints.
See the extension https://github.com/microcks/microcks-quarkus[README.md] for more information.
