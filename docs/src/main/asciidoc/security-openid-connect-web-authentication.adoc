= Quarkus - Using OpenID Connect to Protect Web Applications

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide demonstrates how to use the OpenID Connect Extension to protect your application using Quarkus, where authentication and authorization are based on tokens issued by OpenId Connect and OAuth 2.0 compliant Authorization Servers such as https://www.keycloak.org/about.html[Keycloak].

The extension allows you to easily enable authentication to your web application based on the Authorization Code Flow so that your users are redirected to a
OpenID Connect Provider (e.g.: Keycloak) to authenticate and, once the authentication is complete, return back to your application.

We are going to give you a guideline on how to use OpenId Connect to authenticate users using the Quarkus OpenID Connect Extension.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq tool]
* Docker

== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple web application with a single page:

* `/index.html`

This page is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart \
    -Dextensions="oidc"
cd security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart
----

== Configuring the application

The OpenID Connect extension allows you to define the configuration using the `application.properties` file which should be located at the `src/main/resources` directory.

=== Configuring using the application.properties file

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated
----

This is the simplest configuration you can have when enabling authentication to your application. 

The `quarkus.oidc.client-id` property references the `client_id` issued by the OpenID Connect Provider and, in this case, the application is a public client (no client secret is defined).

The `quarkus.oidc.application-type` property is set to `web-app` in order to tell Quarkus that you want to enable the OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow, so that your users are redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to authenticate.

For last, the `quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated` permission is set to tell Quarkus about the paths you want to protect. In this case,
all paths are being protected by a policy that ensures that only `authenticated` users are allowed to access. For more details check link:security[Security Guide].

== Starting and Configuring the Keycloak Server

To start a Keycloak Server you can use Docker and just run the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 8180:8080 {keycloak-docker-image}
----

You should be able to access your Keycloak Server at http://localhost:8180/auth[localhost:8180/auth].

Log in as the `admin` user to access the Keycloak Administration Console. Username should be `admin` and password `admin`.

Import the {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] to create a new realm. For more details, see the Keycloak documentation about how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_create-realm[create a new realm].

== Running and Using the Application

=== Running in Developer Mode

To run the microservice in dev mode, use `./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev`.

=== Running in JVM Mode

When you're done playing with "dev-mode" you can run it as a standard Java application.

First compile it:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package
----

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar ./target/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart-runner.jar
----

=== Running in Native Mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code: no modifications required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your
production environment, as the runtime technology is included in
the produced binary, and optimized to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compilation will take a bit longer, so this step is disabled by default;
let's build again by enabling the `native` profile:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative
----

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart-runner
----

== Testing the Application

To test the application, you should open your browser and access the following URL:

* http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080]

If everything is working as expected, you should be redirected to the Keycloak server to authenticate.

In order to authenticate to the application you should type the following credentials when at the Keycloak login page:

* Username: *alice*
* Password: *alice*

After clicking the `Login` button you should be redirected back to the application.

== Logout

By default the logout is based on the expiration time of the ID Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider. When the ID Token expires, the current user session at the Quarkus endpoint is invalidated and the user is redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider again to authenticate. If the session at the OpenID Connect Provider is still active, users are automatically re-authenticated without having to provide their credentials again.

The current user session may be automatically extended by enabling a `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-expired` property. If it is set to `true` then when the current ID Token expires a Refresh Token Grant will be used to refresh ID Token as well as Access and Refresh Tokens.

=== User-Initiated Logout

Users can request a logout by sending a request to the Quarkus endpoint logout path set with a `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` property.
For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` is set to "/logout" then the logout request has to be sent to `https://application.com/webapp/logout`.

This logout request will start an https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-Initiated Logout] and the user will be redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to logout where a user may be asked to confirm the logout is indeed intended.

The user will be returned to the endpoint post logout page once the logout has been completed if the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` property is set. For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set to "/signin" then the user will be returned to `https://application.com/webapp/signin` (note this URI must be registered as a valid `post_logout_redirect_uri` in the OpenID Connect Provider).

If the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set then a `q_post_logout` cookie will be created and a matching `state` query parameter will be added to the logout redirect URI and the OpenID Connect Provider will return this `state` once the logout has been completed. It is recommended for the Quarkus `web-app` applications to check that a `state` query parameter matches the value of the `q_post_logout` cookie which can be done for example in a JAX-RS filter.

== Accessing ID and Access Tokens

ID Token is always a JWT token. One can access ID Token claims by injecting `JsonWebToken` with an `IdToken` qualifier:

[source, java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.IdToken;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    @IdToken
    JsonWebToken idToken;

    @GET
    public String getUserName() {
        return idToken.getName();
    }
}
----

Access Token is usually used by the OIDC `web-app` application to access other endpoints on behalf of the currently logged in user. The raw access token can be accessed as follows:

[source, java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.AccessTokenCredential;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    JsonWebToken accessToken;

    // or
    // @Inject
    // AccessTokenCredential accessTokenCredential;

    @GET
    public String getReservationOnBehalfOfUser() {
        String rawAccessToken = accessToken.getRawToken();
        //or
        //String rawAccessToken = accessTokenCredential.getToken();

        // Use the raw access token to access a remote endpoint
        return getReservationfromRemoteEndpoint(rawAccesstoken);
    }
}
----

Note that `AccessTokenCredential` will have to be used if the Access Token issued to the Quarkus `web-app` application is opaque (binary) and can not be parsed to `JsonWebToken`. However the opaque access tokens are not currently supported by the `web-app` applications.

Injection of the `JsonWebToken` and `AccessTokenCredential` is supported in both `@RequestScoped` and `@ApplicationScoped` contexts.
