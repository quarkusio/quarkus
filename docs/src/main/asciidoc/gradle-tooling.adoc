= Building {project-name} apps with Gradle

== Gradle configuration

Configure your project as indicated in the link:gradle-config.html[Gradle configuration page].

At the moment there is no way of automatically generating a new project using the {project-name} Gradle plugin,
luckily setting up a {project-name} project with Gradle is very simple. You only need to add the {project-name} Gradle plugin like this:

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'io.quarkus.gradle.plugin' version '{quarkus-version}'
}
----

or, if you use the Gradle Kotlin DSL:

[source,kotlin,subs=attributes+]
----
plugins {
    java
    id("io.quarkus.gradle.plugin") version "{quarkus-version}"
}
----

[[project-creation]]
== Creating a new project

For now we have to manually create a Gradle project file for {project-name}.
Here is a complete sample file for a simple REST project:

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'io.quarkus.gradle.plugin' version '{quarkus-version}' <1>
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()

    // this is temporary, all dependencies should be in central soon
    maven {
        url = 'http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public'
    }
}

dependencies { <2>
    implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy:{quarkus-version}'
}
----

<1> The {project-name} plugin needs to be applied.
<2> This dependency is needed for a REST application similar to the getting started example.
{project-name} also need this dependency for running tests, to provide this we use the `implementation` configuration.

Here's the same build script, using the Gradle Kotlin DSL:

[source,kotlin,subs=attributes+]
----
plugins {
    java
    id("io.quarkus.gradle.plugin") version "{quarkus-version}"
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()

    // this is temporary, all dependencies should be in central soon
    maven(url = uri("http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public"))
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy:{quarkus-version}")
}
----

== Enable Tests

{project-name} uses Junit5 and to enable it in Gradle we need to add a section to our build file:

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
test {
  useJUnitPlatform()
}
----

To follow up our Rest example from above, we would also need to add two test dependencies:

[source,groovy,subs=attributes+]
----
testCompile group: 'io.quarkus', name: 'quarkus-junit5', version: '{quarkus-version}'
testCompile group: 'io.rest-assured', name: 'rest-assured', version: '{restassured-version}'
----

Note: {project-name} do not allow both link:getting-started-testing.html[QuarkusTests] and link:getting-started-testing.html#native-executable-testing[SubstrateTests] to run in the same test run.
SubstrateTests should be seen as integration tests and moved to a different folder
as recommended here:
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#sec:configuring_java_integration_tests[Configuring integration tests].
{project-name} supports running Substrate tests with Gradle, but the `quarkusNative` task is required to be completed first.

== Dealing with extensions

From inside a {project-name} project, you can obtain a list of the available extensions with:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew listExtensions
----

Functionality to automatically add extensions to your Gradle project is not implemented yet (coming soon).

== Development mode

{project-name} comes with a built-in development mode.
Run your application with:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew quarkusDev
----

You can then update the application sources, resources and configurations.
The changes are automatically reflected in your running application.
This is great to do development spanning UI and database as you see changes reflected immediately.

`quarkusDev` enables hot deployment with background compilation, which means that when you modify
your Java files or your resource files and refresh your browser these changes will automatically take effect.
This works too for resource files like the configuration property file.
The act of refreshing the browser triggers a scan of the workspace, and if any changes are detected the
Java files are compiled, and the application is redeployed, then your request is serviced by the
redeployed application. If there are any issues with compilation or deployment an error page will let you know.

Hit `CTRL+C` to stop the application.

== Debugging

You can run a {project-name} application in debug mode using:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew quarkusDev --debug=true
----

Then, attach your debugger to `localhost:5005`.

== Import in your IDE

Once you have a <<project-creation, project generated>>, you can import it in your favorite IDE.
The only requirement is the ability to import a Gradle project.

**Eclipse**

In Eclipse, click on: `File -> Import`.
In the wizard, select: `Gradle -> Existing Gradle Project`.
On the next screen, select the root location of the project.
The next screen list the found modules; select the generated project and click on `Finish`. Done!

In a separated terminal, run `./gradlew quarkusDev`, and enjoy a highly productive environment.

**IntelliJ**

In IntelliJ:

1. From inside IntelliJ select `File -> New -> Project From Existing Sources...` or, if you are on the welcome dialog, select `Import project`.
2. Select the project root
3. Select `Import project from external model` and `Gradle`
4. Next a few times (review the different options if needed)
5. On the last screen click on Finish

In a separated terminal or in the embedded terminal, run `./gradlew quarkusDev`. Enjoy!

**Apache Netbeans**

In Netbeans:

1. Select `File -> Open Project`
2. Select the project root
3. Click on `Open Project`

In a separated terminal or the embedded terminal, go to the project root and run `./gradlew quarkusDev`. Enjoy!

**Visual Studio Code**

Open the project directory in VS Code. If you have installed the Java Extension Pack (grouping a set of Java extensions), the project is loaded as a Gradle project.

== Building a native executable

Native executables make {project-name} applications ideal for containers and serverless workloads.

Make sure to have `GRAALVM_HOME` configured and pointing to GraalVM version {graalvm-version}.

Create a native executable using: `./gradlew quarkusNative`.
A native executable will be present in `build/`.

=== Build a container friendly executable

The native executable will be specific to your operating system.
To create an executable that will run in a container, use the following:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew quarkusNative --docker-build=true
----

The produced executable will be a 64 bit Linux executable, so depending on your operating system
it may no longer be runnable.
However, it's not an issue as we are going to copy it to a Docker container.
