Quarkus Security is a framework that provides the architecture, multiple authentication and authorization mechanisms, and other tools for you to build secure and production-quality Java applications.

Before building security into your Quarkus applications, learn about the xref:security-architecture.adoc[Quarkus Security architecture] and the different authentication mechanisms and features that you can use.

== Key features of Quarkus Security

The Quarkus Security framework provides built-in security authentication mechanisms for Basic, Form-based, and mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
You can also use other well-known xref:security-authentication-mechanisms.adoc#other-supported-authentication-mechanisms[authentication mechanisms], such as OpenID Connect (OIDC) and WebAuthn.

Authentication mechanisms depend on xref:security-identity-providers.adoc[Identity providers] to verify the authentication credentials and map them to a `SecurityIdentity` instance, which has the username, roles, original authentication credentials, and other attributes.

{project-name} also includes built-in security to allow for role-based access control (RBAC) based on the common security annotations @RolesAllowed, @DenyAll, @PermitAll on REST endpoints, and CDI beans.
For more information, see the Quarkus xref:security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference.adoc[Authorization of web endpoints] guide.

Quarkus Security also supports the following features:

* xref:security-proactive-authentication.adoc[Proactive authentication]
* xref:http-reference.adoc#ssl[Secure connections with SSL/TLS]
* <<cross-origin-resource-sharing>>
* <<csrf-prevention>>
* <<samesite-cookies>>
* <<secrets-engines>>
* <<rest-data-panache>>
* <<secure-serialization>>
* xref:security-vulnerability-detection.adoc[Security vulnerability detection and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) registration]

Quarkus Security is also highly customizable.
For more information, see the Quarkus xref:security-customization.adoc[Security tips and tricks] guide.

== Getting started with Quarkus Security

To get started with security in Quarkus, consider combining the Quarkus built-in xref:security-basic-authentication.adoc[Basic authentication] with the Jakarta Persistence identity provider to enable role-based access control (RBAC).
Complete the steps in the xref:security-basic-authentication-tutorial.adoc[Secure a Quarkus application with Basic authentication] tutorial.

After successfully securing your Quarkus application with Basic authentication, you can increase the security further by adding more advanced authentication mechanisms, for example, the xref:security-oidc-code-flow-authentication.adoc[OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization code flow mechanism].

== Quarkus Security testing

Guidance for testing Quarkus Security features and ensuring that your Quarkus applications are securely protected is provided in the Quarkus xref:security-testing.adoc[Security testing] guide.

== More about security features in Quarkus

[[cross-origin-resource-sharing]]
=== Cross-origin resource sharing

To make your Quarkus application accessible to another application running on a different domain, you need to configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
For more information about the CORS filter that Quarkus provides, see the Quarkus xref:http-reference.adoc#cors-filter[CORS filter] section of the "HTTP reference" guide.

[[csrf-prevention]]
=== Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention

Quarkus Security provides a RESTEasy Reactive filter that can protect your applications against a https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf[Cross-Site Request Forgery] attack.
For more information, see the Quarkus xref:security-csrf-prevention.adoc[Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention] guide.

[[samesite-cookies]]
=== SameSite cookies

You can add a link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite[SameSite] cookie property to any of the cookies set by a Quarkus endpoint.
For more information, see the Quarkus xref:http-reference.adoc#same-site-cookie[SameSite cookies] guide.

[[secrets-engines]]
=== Secrets engines
Secrets engines are components that store, generate, or encrypt data.

Quarkus provides comprehensive HashiCorp Vault support.
For more information, see the link:{vault-guide}[Quarkus and HashiCorp Vault] documentation.

[[secure-serialization]]
=== Secure serialization

If your Quarkus Security architecture includes RESTEasy Reactive and Jackson, Quarkus can limit the fields that are included in JSON serialization based on the configured security.
For more information, see the Quarkus xref:resteasy-reactive.adoc#secure-serialization[Writing REST services with RESTEasy Reactive] guide.

[[rest-data-panache]]
=== Secure auto-generated resources by REST Data with Panache

If you use the REST Data with Panache extension to auto-generate your resources, you can still use security annotations within the package `jakarta.annotation.security`.
For more information, see the xref:rest-data-panache.adoc#securing-endpoints[Securing auto-generated resources] section of the Quarkus "Generating Jakarta REST resources with Panache" guide.

== Security vulnerability detection

Most Quarkus tags get reported in the US link:https://nvd.nist.gov[National Vulnerability Database (NVD)].
For information about security vulnerabilities, see the xref:security-vulnerability-detection.adoc[Security vulnerability detection and reporting in Quarkus] guide.
