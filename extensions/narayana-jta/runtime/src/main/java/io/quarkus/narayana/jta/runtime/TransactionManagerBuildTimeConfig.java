     * Either use XA for all resources if you want consistency, or split the code into separate
     * methods with separate transactions.
     * <p>
     * Note that using a single XA unaware resource together with XA aware resources, known as
     * the Last Resource Commit Optimization (LRCO), is different from using multiple XA unaware
     * resources. Although LRCO allows most transactions to complete normally, some errors can
     * cause an inconsistent transaction outcome. Using multiple XA unaware resources is not
     * recommended since the probability of inconsistent outcomes is significantly higher and
     * much harder to recover from than LRCO. For this reason, use LRCO as a last resort.
     * <p>
     * We do not recommend using this configuration property, and we plan to remove it in the future,
     * so you should plan fixing your application accordingly.
     * If you think your use case of this feature is valid and this option should be kept around,
     * open an issue in our tracker explaining why.
