# Key Differences: Why Nx Doesn't Work Exactly Like Maven

## The Core Issues

### 1. **Task Decomposition Problem**

**Maven's Native Behavior:**
```bash
mvn install
# Single command that internally runs ALL phases as one atomic operation
# validate → compile → test → package → verify → install
```

**Current Nx Behavior:**
```java
// From TargetGenerationService.java:79
TargetConfiguration target = new TargetConfiguration("nx:noop");

// From TargetGenerationService.java:162  
options.put("command", "mvn " + pluginKey + ":" + goal);
```

**Problem:** Nx breaks Maven phases into separate tasks, destroying Maven's atomic execution model.

### 2. **Cross-Project Dependencies Issue**

**Maven's Native Behavior:**
```bash
cd core/runtime
mvn install
# Only builds this project
# Assumes dependencies are already built
```

**Current Nx Behavior:**
```java
// From TargetDependencyService.java:88
dependsOn.add("^" + phase);
```

**Problem:** Nx automatically adds `^install` dependencies, forcing dependency projects to be built, which Maven doesn't do.

### 3. **Phase vs Goal Execution**

**Maven's Native Behavior:**
```bash
mvn install
# Executes: ALL goals bound to ALL phases up to 'install'
# Example: maven-compiler:compile, maven-surefire:test, maven-jar:jar, maven-install:install
# All in single process with shared state
```

**Current Nx Behavior:**
```java
// Phase targets are no-ops:
TargetConfiguration target = new TargetConfiguration("nx:noop");

// Goal targets run individual commands:
options.put("command", "mvn " + pluginKey + ":" + goal);
```

**Problem:** Nx runs individual goal commands separately, losing Maven's integrated lifecycle execution.

## Specific Behavioral Differences

### 1. **Plugin State Sharing**
- **Maven**: Plugins can share state between goals within the same lifecycle execution
- **Nx**: Each goal runs in isolation, no state sharing

### 2. **Lifecycle Hook Execution**
- **Maven**: Lifecycle extensions and build participants run at specific phase transitions
- **Nx**: No lifecycle hooks since phases are no-ops

### 3. **Maven Session Context**
- **Maven**: Single Maven session with full project context
- **Nx**: Multiple separate Maven invocations with limited context

### 4. **Plugin Configuration Resolution**
- **Maven**: Plugin configurations resolved once for entire lifecycle
- **Nx**: Plugin configurations resolved separately for each goal execution

### 5. **Dependency Management**
- **Maven**: Dependencies resolved once and cached for entire build
- **Nx**: Dependencies may be resolved multiple times

## How to Make Nx Work Exactly Like Maven

### Option 1: **Full Maven Command Targets**

Instead of breaking down phases, create targets that run full Maven commands:

```java
// Instead of "nx:noop" phases, create actual Maven command targets:
TargetConfiguration target = new TargetConfiguration("nx:run-commands");
options.put("command", "mvn install"); // Full Maven command
options.put("cwd", actualProjectPath);
```

**Result:**
```bash
nx install core/runtime
# Would run: mvn install -f core/runtime/pom.xml
# Exactly like Maven behavior
```

### Option 2: **Remove Cross-Project Auto-Dependencies**

```java
// Remove this line from TargetDependencyService.java:88
// dependsOn.add("^" + phase);
```

**Result:**
```bash
nx install core/runtime
# Would only build core/runtime
# Just like Maven: cd core/runtime && mvn install
```

### Option 3: **Maven Reactor-Style Execution**

Create targets that run Maven reactor builds:

```java
TargetConfiguration target = new TargetConfiguration("nx:run-commands");
options.put("command", "mvn install -pl " + projectPath + " -am");
// -am = also make dependencies
```

**Result:**
```bash
nx install core/runtime  
# Would run: mvn install -pl core/runtime -am
# Builds dependencies but uses Maven's reactor
```

## Advantages Lost by Making Nx "Exactly Like Maven"

### 1. **No Incremental Builds**
```bash
# Current Nx:
nx install core/runtime  # Only rebuilds what changed

# Maven-like Nx:  
nx install core/runtime  # Always rebuilds everything
```

### 2. **No Task-Level Parallelization**
```bash
# Current Nx: Can run tests in parallel across projects
# Maven-like Nx: Sequential execution like Maven
```

### 3. **No Fine-Grained Caching**
```bash
# Current Nx: Cache compile, test, package separately
# Maven-like Nx: All-or-nothing caching
```

### 4. **No Smart Task Selection**
```bash
# Current Nx: nx test (runs just tests)
# Maven-like Nx: Must run full lifecycle phases
```

## The Fundamental Tension

**Maven's Model**: Monolithic lifecycle execution with integrated state management
**Nx's Model**: Decomposed task execution with dependency orchestration

Making Nx work "exactly like Maven" means:
- ✅ Perfect compatibility with Maven plugins and lifecycle
- ❌ Loss of Nx's performance optimizations
- ❌ Loss of incremental builds
- ❌ Loss of task-level parallelization
- ❌ Loss of fine-grained caching

## Recommendation

The current approach is a reasonable compromise, but the main incompatibilities are:

1. **Automatic cross-project dependencies** (`^phase`) - this is the biggest difference
2. **Task decomposition** instead of monolithic phase execution
3. **Individual goal execution** instead of integrated lifecycle

To make Nx more Maven-like while keeping some benefits, consider:
- Making cross-project dependencies opt-in rather than automatic
- Providing "maven-compatible" target variants that run full lifecycle commands
- Adding a mode that preserves Maven's session context across goal executions
