A detailed reference for the structure and composition of Quarkus documentation.

== AsciiDoc syntax

Quarkus docs use AsciiDoc syntax.
The following links provide background on AsciiDoc syntax and general conventions.

* https://redhat-documentation.github.io/asciidoc-markup-conventions/[AsciiDoc Mark-up Quick Reference for Documentation]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoctor User Manual]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]

== Language and grammar

Write clear, concise, and consistent technical information in US English. 
Write for a global audience with localization, translation, inclusivity, and diversity in mind. 
Try to use the following grammar styles:

* link:https://developers.google.com/style/tense?hl=en[Present tense]
* link:https://developers.google.com/style/voice?hl=en[Active voice] 
* link:https://developers.google.com/style/person?hl=en[Second person (you)]
* link:https://developers.google.com/style/tone?hl=en[A conversational tone]
* link:https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns?hl=en[Gender neutral language]

== Sentence length

Shorter sentences are much easier to read and translate. Try to use less than 32 words per sentence.

== Website publication

Content from this repository is published to the https://quarkus.io/guides/[Quarkus.io website].

- Documentation built from the main branch is published nightly (main-SNAPSHOT).
- Documentation for other branches is published at release time.

== Titles and headings

Regardless of content type, ensure that the main title and any headings in your document are:

* Goal-oriented and use the language and keywords of the audience
* Descriptive and avoid filler words
* Between 3-12 words and 50-80 characters per line to optimize findability in search engines
* In sentence case capitalization style

Your titles and headings must also follow the specific guidance for the Quarkus content types, as outlined in the following table:

.Title guidance for different Quarkus content types
[cols="15%,25%a,30%,30%"]
|===
|Content type |Should ... |Good example|Bad example

|Concept
|* Start with a noun that names the concept or topic
* Never start with an active verb, for example, an action word like configure, install, or start
* Finish the implied sentence: "Understanding ..."
|Security and authentication mechanisms in Quarkus
|Discovering Reactive SQL Clients In Quarkus

|How-To Guide
|* Start with an active verb in the imperative verb form, for example, "Create a ..." or "Secure a ..."
* Be action-oriented or task-oriented, rather than feature-oriented
* Finish the implied sentence: "How to ..."
|Secure your Quarkus application with WebAuthn authentication
|Applying WebAuthn Authentication In Quarkus

|Reference
|* Use a noun phrase to concisely summarize the content of the document
* Not include the word 'reference'
* Finish the implied sentence: "About ..."
|Hibernate Reactive API configuration properties
|Reference guide for Configuring Hibernate Reactive API Configuration Properties

|Tutorial
|* Start with an active verb in the imperative verb form, for example, "Create a ..." or "Secure a ..."
* State what task the user will complete, with emphasis on the key topic or demonstrated activity
* Be action-oriented or task-oriented, rather than feature-oriented
* Be led by the needs of the user in learning mode.
* Finish the implied sentence: "In this tutorial, you will ..."

== File conventions

=== Source locations

- AsciiDoc files are in the `src/main/asciidoc` directory within the `docs` module of the {quarkus-base-url}/tree/main/docs[Quarkus GitHub repository].
- Configuration documentation is generated from JavaDoc comments in Java source files.
- Java, YAML, and other source files can also be referenced by AsciiDoc files.

=== Output locations

Configuration references:: Configuration reference documentation is generated from Javadoc comments discovered in MicroProfile Config source files.
These generated files are in `target/asciidoc/generated/config/` (from the project root).

AsciiDoc output to HTML:: AsciiDoc processing creates HTML files in `docs/target/generated-docs/`.

=== Templates

Create new documentation files with the appropriate template for the content type: 

Concepts:: Use `docs/src/main/asciidoc/_templates/template-concepts.adoc`
How-To Guides:: Use `docs/src/main/asciidoc/_templates/template-howto.adoc`
Reference:: Use `docs/src/main/asciidoc/_templates/template-reference.adoc`
Tutorials:: Use `docs/src/main/asciidoc/_templates/template-tutorial.adoc`

=== File names

Quarkus documentation uses a flat hierarchy.

The bulk of the file name should be some representation of its title.
Use all lowercase letters, separate words with hyphens, and avoid symbols and special characters.

Prefix:: Use a common prefix to group related documents. Documents related to writing and contributing to Quarkus docs share the `doc-` prefix, for example.

Suffix:: The file name should reflect the document type:

- Concept documents should end in `-concepts.adoc`
- How-to guides should end in `-howto.adoc`
- References should end in `-reference.adoc`
- Tutorials should end in `-tutorial.adoc`

== Document structure

=== Document header

Each document should define a header for document-scoped attributes. 
Minimally, each document should define and id and a title, and include common attributes (`_attributes.adoc`).

[source,asciidoc]
----
[id="reference-doc-quarkus-documentation"] // <1>
= Quarkus documentation reference // <2>
\include::_attributes.adoc[] // <3>
:categories: contributing // <4>
----

<1> Specify an id for your document. 
It should start with the document type: `concept-`, `howto-`, `reference-`, or `tutorial-`.
<2> Define the document title following guidance in <<Titles and headings>>
<3> Include common document attributes
<4> Specify the relevant <<Categories>> (comma separated)

==== Other common document attributes:

`:extension-status: preview`:: Use this attribute to flag special types of content. Valid values: `experimental`, `preview`, `stable` (not usually used), and `deprecated`.
`:summary: <text>`:: Use the summary to provide a concise (26 words or less) description of the document. 
This attribute will be used in tiles or other descriptions on the website. If not present, the contents of the <<Abstracts (preamble),preamble>> will be used instead.

NOTE: Take care with whitespace when working with document-scoped attributes. The document header ends with the first blank line. 

=== Abstracts (preamble)

Add a short description that helps your audience to quickly find and understand the purpose and intent of the page.

Try to write the abstract by using the following guidelines:

* *User oriented:* Contains terms and keywords that are familiar to users.
* *Concise:* Avoids self-referential expressions and filler words, for example, "This document..", "This tutorial..", or "The following.."
* *Brief:* Is no more than three sentences long. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The first sentence of the abstract must explain the value and some benefit of the content in less than 27 words because this automatically displays on the link:https://quarkus.io/guides/[Quarkus guides homepage].
====

=== Semantic line breaks

:semantic-line-breaks: footnote:smbl[Rhodes, B. Semantic Linefeeds. https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/]

Text in paragraphs, lists, and tables should be broken into pieces that are easier to review{semantic-line-breaks}.
Start a new line at the end of each sentence, and split sentences themselves at natural breaks between clauses.

=== Using sections

Section titles should be written in sentence case, rather than title case.

All documents should start with a Title (a `= Level 0` heading), and should 
be broken into subsections where appropriate
(`== Level 1` to `====== Level 5`)
without skipping any levels.

[TIP]
====
Deep nesting (`====== Level 4`, `====== Level 5`)
should be avoided whenever possible.
If you end up with deeply nested sections, think about the following:

- Is this information in the right place?
For example, if this is a reference, should some of this content be moved to a concept doc or how-to guide instead?
- Can the content be reorganized to make it simpler to consume?

See xref:{doc-guides}/doc-concepts.adoc[Quarkus documentation concepts] for more information about content types and organization.
====

=== Links

In general, prefer https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/url-macro/[url macros] to bare or automatic links.
Provide human-readable text for the link, especially if it is included in the middle of other text.

.A URL Macro link with attributes
[NOTE]
=====
The URL macro also supports https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/link-macro-ref/[additional attributes] that may be relevant, like opening a link in a different window.

[source,asciidoc]
----
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference,window=_blank,opts=nofollow]
----

The above source produces this link: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference,window=_blank,opts=nofollow].
=====

=== Cross-references

Quarkus documentation is built from source in a few different environments.
We use attributes in our cross-references to ensure our docs can be built across these environments.

.Cross-reference source attributes
[cols="<m,<2",options="header"]
|===
|Attribute|Description
|\{code-examples}|Relative path to directory containing collected example source files
|\{doc-examples}|Relative path to source examples for documentation guides
|\{doc-guides}|Relative path to documentation adoc files
|\{generated-dir}|Relative path to generated configuration `*.adoc` files
|\{imagesdir}|Relative path to directory containing images
|\{includes}|Relative path to directory containing partial/reusable content
|===

When cross-referencing content, always use the inter-document `xref:` syntax and supply a human-readable label to your link.

.Cross-reference example
[source,asciidoc]
----
xref:{doc-guides}/doc-concepts.adoc[Quarkus Documentation concepts] <1>
----
<1> The cross reference starts with `xref:`, uses a cross-reference source attribute(`\{doc-guides}`), and provides a readable description: `[Quarkus Documentation concepts]`.

=== Reference source code 

There are many ways to include source code and examples in documentation.

The simplest is to write it directly in the file, like this:

[source,asciidoc]
-----
[source,java]
----
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
----
-----

In documents like tutorials, you may want to reference source code that is built and tested regularly.
The Quarkus documentation build will copy source files enumerated in `*-examples/yaml` files into a flattened structure in the `target/asciidoc/examples` directory (from the project root).

[source,yaml]
----
examples:
- source: path/to/source/file/SomeClassFile.java <1>
  target: prefix-simplified-unique-filename.java <2>
----

<1> define the path of source to be copied
<2> define the simplified target file name to use when copying the file into the `target/asciidoc/examples` directory.

Content copied in this way is referenced by the `\{code-examples}` source attribute. The literal string `{{source}}` in the source file, if present, will be replaced with the path of the source file in the copy.

.Micrometer example
* The source file to be copied is:
+
`integration-tests/micrometer-prometheus/src/main/java/documentation/example/telemetry/micrometer/tutorial/ExampleResource.java`

* The target file name we want to use in docs is:
+
`telemetry-micrometer-tutorial-example-resource.java`.

* The source and target file names are declared in `docs/src/main/asciidoc/telemetry-examples.yaml`: 
+
[source,yaml]
----
examples:
- source: integration-tests/micrometer-prometheus/src/main/java/io/quarkus/doc/micrometer/ExampleResource.java
  target: telemetry-micrometer-tutorial-example-resource.java
----

* Snippets from this source file are then referenced with the following path:
+
`\{code-examples}/telemetry-micrometer-tutorial-example-resource.java`.
* The source file contains the following comment: 
[source,java]
----
// Source: {{source}}
----
* The copied file contains this comment instead: 
[source,java]
----
// Source: integration-tests/micrometer-prometheus/src/main/java/io/quarkus/doc/micrometer/ExampleResource.java
----
