/**
 * Represents a stream of items that can be read from.
 * <p>
 * Any class that implements this interface can be used by a {@link Pump} to pump data from it
 * to a {@link WriteStream}.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Streaming mode</h3>
 * The stream is either in <i>flowing</i> or <i>fetch</i> mode.
 * <ul>
 *   <i>Initially the stream is in <i>flowing</i> mode.</i>
 *   <li>When the stream is in <i>flowing</i> mode, elements are delivered to the {@code handler}.</li>
 *   <li>When the stream is in <i>fetch</i> mode, only the number of requested elements will be delivered to the {@code handler}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The mode can be changed with the {@link #pause()}, {@link #resume()} and {@link #fetch} methods:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Calling {@link #resume()} sets the <i>flowing</i> mode</li>
 *   <li>Calling {@link #pause()} sets the <i>fetch</i> mode and resets the demand to {@code 0}</li>
 *   <li>Calling {@link #fetch(long)} requests a specific amount of elements and adds it to the actual demand</li>
 * </ul>
