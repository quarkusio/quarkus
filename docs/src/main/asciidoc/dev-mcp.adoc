.Experimental
====
This feature is currently experimental. To enable it, set `quarkus.dev-mcp.enabled=true` in your application properties.

== Overview

When you run a Quarkus application in dev mode, you can expose a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. 
It presents the methods used by the DevUI *MCP tools* (methods you can call) and the data exposed by *MCP resources*. 

=== Connecting an MCP client

Open the **Dev MCP** menu in the Dev UI to see the MCP server’s URL. (Default `http://localhost:8080/q/dev-mcp`). 
Any MCP client that supports the https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26[Streamable Protocol, version 2025‑03‑26] can connect using that URL. 
After a client connects, it appears on the *MCP Info* page of the Dev UI.

== Guide for extension developers

Extensions can contribute additional tools and resources to the Dev MCP server. The integration is similar to contributing to the xref:dev-ui.adoc[Dev UI], but descriptions are mandatory. 
A single JSON‑RPC service can be used for both Dev UI and Dev MCP; methods without a description only show up in Dev UI, while methods with a description appear in both.

=== MCP resources

A resource is data exposed by your extension. There are two ways to create a resource.

==== MCP Resources against build time data

Build‑time data that is already exposed to the xref:dev-ui.adoc#optional-build-time-data[Dev UI] can also be made available to Dev MCP. Provide a description when calling `addBuildTimeData()`:

[source,java]
----
footerPageBuildItem.addBuildTimeData(
    "jokes",
    jokesBuildItem.getJokes(),
    "Some funny jokes that the user might enjoy"
);
----

The extra `description` argument is new: without it the data only appears in the Dev UI. Once supplied, the `jokes` data becomes an MCP resource.

==== MCP Resources against a recorded value

To expose recorded values (data produced at runtime by a recorder) as an MCP resource, define a xref:dev-ui.adoc#jsonrpc-against-a-recorded-value[build‑time action] in the deployment module. The action must include a description:

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep(onlyIf = IsLocalDevelopment.class)
BuildTimeActionBuildItem createBuildTimeActions() {
    BuildTimeActionBuildItem item = new BuildTimeActionBuildItem(); //<1>
    item.actionBuilder() //<2>
            .methodName("getMyRecordedValue")
            .description("A well‑thought‑out description") //<3>
            .runtime(runtimeValue) //<4>
            .build();
    return item;
}
----
<1> Return or produce a `BuildTimeActionBuildItem`.
<2> Use the builder to configure the action.
<3> Set a human‑readable description.
<4> Provide the runtime value returned by your recorder.

=== MCP tools

A tool corresponds to a method that a client can call. Any JSON‑RPC method can be exposed as a tool by supplying descriptions on the method and its parameters.
Tools can run on either the runtime or deployment classpath.

==== MCP Tools against the Runtime classpath

To expose runtime information or actions (for example, changing log levels), define a xref:dev-ui.adoc#jsonrpc-against-the-runtime-classpath[JSON‑RPC service] in your runtime or runtime‑dev module and annotate the methods and parameters with `@JsonRpcDescription`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyExtensionRPCService {

    @JsonRpcDescription("Update a specific logger's level in this Quarkus application") // <1>
    public JsonObject updateLogLevel(
            @JsonRpcDescription("The logger name as defined in the logging implementation") String loggerName,
            @JsonRpcDescription("The new log level") String levelValue) { // <2>
        // implementation…
    }
}
----
<1> Description of the method.
<2> Description of each parameter.

You must register the JSON‑RPC service in the deployment module:

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep
JsonRPCProvidersBuildItem registerRpcService() { // <1>
    return new JsonRPCProvidersBuildItem(MyExtensionRPCService.class); // <2>
}
----
<1> Produce a `JsonRPCProvidersBuildItem`.
<2> Specify the class in your runtime or runtime‑dev module that contains the methods.

`@JsonRpcDescription` is mandatory for Dev MCP; without it the method is only available in the Dev UI. 
The method can return primitives, `String`, `JsonObject`, `JsonArray`, or any POJO that can be serialised to JSON. 
Asynchronous methods (`Uni`, `CompletionStage` or methods annotated with `@NonBlocking`) are also supported.

==== MCP Tools against the Deployment classpath

Sometimes you need to run xref:dev-ui.adoc#jsonrpc-against-the-deployment-classpath[actions on the deployment classpath] (for example, writing configuration files). In that case you do not create a JSON‑RPC service; instead you provide a supplier via a `BuildTimeActionBuildItem`:

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep(onlyIf = IsLocalDevelopment.class)
BuildTimeActionBuildItem createBuildTimeActions() {
    BuildTimeActionBuildItem actions = new BuildTimeActionBuildItem();
    actions.actionBuilder()
            .methodName("updateProperty")
            .description("Update a configuration/property in the Quarkus application")   // <1>
            .parameter("name", "The name of the configuration/property to update")       // <2>
            .parameter("value", "The new value for the configuration/property")
            .function(map -> {
                Map<String, String> values = Collections.singletonMap(
                        map.get("name"), map.get("value"));
                updateConfig(values);
                return true;
            })
            .build();
    return actions;
}
----
<1> Description of the method.
<2> Description of each parameter.

The code in the `function` runs on the deployment classpath. The function can return a plain value, a `CompletionStage` or `CompletableFuture` for asynchronous work.

=== JSON‑RPC usage

By default all JSON‑RPC methods are visible in the Dev UI. Only methods with descriptions are exposed via Dev MCP. 
You can override this behaviour with the `@JsonRpcUsage` annotation. Pass one or both of the `Usage` enums (`DEV_UI`, `DEV_MCP`) to control where a method is exposed.
