The TLS registry is a Quarkus extension centralizing the TLS configuration for the application.
It allows to define the TLS configuration in a single place and to reference it from multiple places in the application.

The TLS extension should be automatically added to your project as soon as you use a compatible extension.
For example, if your application uses Quarkus REST, gRPC or reactive routes, the TLS registry is automatically added to your project.

== Examples

To configure a TLS connection, and more specifically the key stores and trust stores, you use the `quarkus.tls.*` properties.

Configuration directly under `quarkus.tls` is the default configuration that will be used by all the TLS connections in the application.
However, you can also have specific configurations for specific connections by using the `quarkus.tls.<name>.*` properties.

=== Configure the HTTP server to use https://

To configure the HTTP server to use HTTPS, you can use the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.cert=server.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.key=server.key
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled # Reject HTTP requests
----

So you a `p12` (PKCS12) key store, use the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled # Reject HTTP requests
----

Instead of the default configuration, you can use a named configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=https
----

=== Configure a client to use https://

As an example to illustrate client configuration, we will use a gRPC client:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.path=grpc-client-truststore.jks
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.password=password

quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.plain-text=false
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.use-quarkus-grpc-client=true
----

=== Configuring mTLS

To configure mTLS, you need to configure both the server and the client.
Both will receive a key store and a trust store:

- the server key store contains the server certificate and private key
- the client key store contains the client certificate and private key
- the server trust store contains the client certificate (to authenticate the client)
- the client trust store contains the server certificate (to authenticate the server)

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.my-server.key-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-server.key-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.my-server.trust-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-server-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-server.trust-store.p12.password=password

quarkus.tls.my-client.trust-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-client-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-client.trust-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.my-client.key-store.p12.path=target/certs/grpc-client-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.my-client.key-store.p12.password=password

quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.plain-text=false
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.tls-configuration-name=my-client
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.use-quarkus-grpc-client=true

quarkus.http.ssl.client-auth=REQUIRED # Enable mTLS
quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=my-server
quarkus.grpc.server.use-separate-server=false
quarkus.grpc.server.plain-text=false
----

[#referencing-a-tls-configuration]
== Referencing a TLS configuration

Once you have configured a _named_ configuration using `quarkus.tls.<name>`, you need to reference it.
This is done using the `tls-configuration-name` property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.https.key-store.p12.password=secret

quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=https # Reference the named configuration
----

== Configuring TLS

Configuring TLS is mainly about key stores and trust stores.
The configuration depends on the format (`pem`, `p12`, `jks`...).
There are other important properties too.
This section details the various properties you can use to configure TLS.

=== Key stores

Key stores are used to store the private key and the certificate.
They are mainly used on the server-side, but can also be used on the client-side when mTLS is used.

==== PEM key stores

PEM key stores are composed of a list of pair of two files: the certificate and the private key.
The certificate file is a `.crt` or `.pem` file, and the private key file is often a `.key` file.

To configure a PEM key store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.a.cert=server.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.a.key=server.key
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.b.cert=my-second-cert.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.b.key=my-second-key.key
----

In general, you will only need one pair of certificate and private key.
The certificate may contain multiple certificates (a chain), but there should be one private key.

When multiple pairs are configured, the selection is done using SNI (Server Name Indication).
The client will send the server name it wants to connect to, and the server will select the appropriate pair of certificate and private key.
Make sure xref:./tls-registry-reference.adoc#sni[SNI] is enabled on both the client and server to use this feature.

IMPORTANT: When configuring multiple key/cert pairs, the order is following the lexicographical order of the name (`a` and `b` in the previous snippet). So, the first pair is the one with the lowest lexicographical order. You can define the order by using the `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.order` property, for example: `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.order=b,c,a`. This is important when using SNI, as the first pair is the default one.

==== PKCS12 key stores

PKCS12 key stores are a single file containing the certificate and the private key.
To configure a PKCS12 key store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
----

`.p12` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the key store.
Also, they can include more than one certificate and private key.
In this case, you can:

- either provide the alias of the certificate and private key you want to use
- or use SNI to select the appropriate certificate and private key (all keys must use the same password)

To configure the alias, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.path=server-keystore.p12
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.password=secret
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.alias=my-alias
quarkus.tls.key-store.p12.alias-password=my-alias-password
----

==== JKS key stores

JKS key stores are a single file containing the certificate and the private key.
Note that the JKS format should be avoided as it is less secure than PKCS12.
To configure a JKS key store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.path=server-keystore.jks
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.password=secret
----

`.jks` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the key store.
Also, they can include more than one certificate and private key.
In this case, you can:

- either provide the alias of the certificate and private key you want to use
- or use SNI to select the appropriate certificate and private key (all keys must use the same password)

To configure the alias, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.path=server-keystore.jks
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.password=secret
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.alias=my-alias
quarkus.tls.key-store.jks.alias-password=my-alias-password
----

[#sni]
==== SNI

Server Name Indication (SNI) is a TLS extension that allows a client to specify the hostname it is attempting to connect to during the TLS handshake.
It enables a server to present different TLS certificates for multiple domains on a single IP address, facilitating secure communication for virtual hosting scenarios.

To enable SNI, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.key-store.sni=true # Disabled by default
----

With this setting enabled, the client indicate the server name during the TLS handshake, allowing the server to select the right certificate:

- When configuring the keystore with PEM files, multiple CRT/Key must be given.
- When configuring the keystore with a JKS or a P12 file, it selects one alias based on the SNI hostname. In this case, all the keystore password and alias password must be the same. Do not set the `alias` property in this case.

==== Credential providers

Instead of passing the key store password and alias password in the configuration, you can use a credential provider.

A credential provider offers a way to retrieve the key store password and alias password.
Note that the credential provider is only used if the password / alias password are not set in the configuration.

To configure a credential provider, use the following properties:

[source, properties]
----
# The name of the credential bucket in the credentials provider
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.name=my-credentials

# The name of the bean providing the credential provider (optional, using the default credential provider if not set)
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.bean-name=my-credentials-provider

# The key used to retrieve the key store password, `password` by default
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.password-key=password

# The key used to retrieve the alias password, `alias-password` by default
quarkus.tls.key-store.credentials-provider.alias-password-key=alias-password
----

IMPORTANT: The credential provider can only be used with PKCS12 and JKS key stores.

=== Trust stores

Trust stores are used to store the certificates of the trusted parties.
They are generally used on the client-side, and on the server-side when mTLS is used.

==== PEM trust stores

PEM trust stores are composed of a list of `.crt` or `.pem` files.
Each of them contains a certificate.

To configure a PEM trust store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.pem.certs=ca.crt,ca2.pem
----

==== PKCS12 trust stores

PKCS12 trust stores are a single file containing the certificates.
When multiple certificates are included, you can use the alias to select the appropriate certificate.

To configure a PKCS12 trust store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.path=client-truststore.p12
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.password=password
quarkus.tls.trust-store.p12.alias=my-alias
----

`.p12` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the trust store.
However, unlike for key stores, the alias does not require a password (because it's the public certificate and not a private key).

==== JKS trust stores

JKS trust stores are a single file containing the certificates.
When multiple certificates are included, you can use the alias to select the appropriate certificate.
Note that the JKS format should be avoided as it is less secure than PKCS12.

To configure a JKS trust store, use the following properties:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.path=client-truststore.jks
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.password=password
quarkus.tls.trust-store.jks.alias=my-alias
----

`.jks` files are password-protected, so you need to provide the password to open the trust store.
However, unlike for key stores, the alias does not require a password (because it's the public certificate and not a private key).

==== Credential providers

Instead of passing the trust store password in the configuration, you can use a credential provider.

A credential provider offers a way to retrieve passwords and other credentials.
Note that the credential provider is only used if the password is not set in the configuration.

To configure a credential provider, use the following properties:

[source, properties]
----
# The name of the credential bucket in the credentials provider
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.name=my-credentials

# The name of the bean providing the credential provider (optional, using the default credential provider if not set)
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.bean-name=my-credentials-provider

# The key used to retrieve the trust store password, `password` by default
quarkus.tls.trust-store.credentials-provider.password-key=password
----

IMPORTANT: The credential provider can only be used with PKCS12 and JKS trust stores.

=== Other properties

While key stores and trust stores are the most important properties, there are other properties you can use to configure TLS.

NOTE: while the following examples use the _default_ configuration, you can use the _named_ configuration by prefixing the properties with the name of the configuration.

==== Cipher suites

The cipher suites are the list of ciphers that can be used during the TLS handshake.
You can configure the ordered list of enabled cipher suites.
If not configured, a reasonable default is selected from the built-in ciphers.
However, when configured, it takes precedence over the default suite defined by the SSL engine in use.

To configure the cipher suites, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.cipher-suites=TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
----

==== TLS protocol versions

The TLS protocol versions are the list of protocols that can be used during the TLS handshake.
You can configure the ordered list of enabled TLS protocols.
If not configured , it defaults to `TLSv1.3`, `TLSv1.2`.

Are supported: `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.3`.

To only enable `TLSv1.3`, configure the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.protocols=TLSv1.3
----

==== Handshake timeout

When a TLS connection is established, the handshake phase is the first step.
During this phase, the client and server exchange information to establish the connection, typically the cipher suite, the TLS protocol version, the certification validation and so on.

To configure the timeout for the handshake phase, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.handshake-timeout=10S # Default.
----

==== ALPN

Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is a TLS extension that allows the client and server during the TLS handshake to negotiate which protocol they will use for communication.
ALPN enables more efficient communication by allowing the client to indicate its preferred application protocol to the server before the TLS connection is established.

This helps in scenarios such as HTTP/2 where multiple protocols may be available, allowing for faster protocol selection.

ALPN is enabled by default.
To disable it, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.alpn=false
----

==== Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of certificates that have been revoked by the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) before their scheduled expiration date.
When a certificate is compromised, no longer needed, or deemed invalid for any reason, the CA adds it to the CRL to inform relying parties not to trust the certificate anymore.

You can configure the CRL with the list of certificate files you do not trust anymore.
Two formats are allowed: DER and PKCS#7 (also known as P7B).

* When using the DER format, you must pass DER-encoded CRLs.
* When using the PKCS#7 format, you must pass PKCS#7 `SignedData` object, with the only significant field being `crls`.

To configure the CRL, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.certificate-revocation-list=ca.crl, ca2.crl
----

==== Trusting all certificates and hostname verification

IMPORTANT: These two properties should not be used in production.

You can configure your TLS connection to trust all certificates and to disable the hostname verification.
These are two different steps:

- trusting all certificates ignores the certificate validation, so all certificates are trusted. It is useful for testing with self-signed certificates, but should not be used in production.
- hostname verification is the process of verifying the server's identity. It is useful to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. It often defaults to `HTTPS` or `LDAPS`.

To trust all certificates, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.trust-all=true
----

To disable the hostname verification, use the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.tls.hostname-verification-algorithm=NONE
----

=== Configuration reference

The following table lists the supported properties:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-tls.adoc[opts=optional, leveloffset=+1]

== The registry API

While extensions will automatically use the TLS registry, you can also use the registry API to access the TLS configuration programmatically.

To access the TLS configuration, inject the `TlsConfigurationRegistry` bean and gets the TLS configuration by name (or the default one):

[source,java]
----
 @Inject
 TlsConfigurationRegistry certificates;
// ...
TlsConfiguration def = certificates.getDefault().orElseThrow();
TlsConfiguration named = certificates.get("name").orElseThrow();
//...
----

The `TlsConfiguration` object contains the key stores, trust stores, cipher suites, protocols, and other properties.
It also provides a way to create an `SSLContext` from the configuration.

As Vert.x is omnipresent in Quarkus, you can also use the `TlsConfiguration` object to configure the Vert.x client or server such as `KeyCertOptions`, `TrustOptions`, and so on.

== Registering a certificate from an extension

This section is only for extension developers.
An extension can register a certificate in the TLS registry.
This is useful when an extension needs to provide a certificate to the application or provides a different format.

To achieve this, the extension _processor_ must produce a `TlsCertificateBuildItem`.
A `TlsCertificateBuildItem` is composed of a name and a `CertificateSupplier`.

[source,java]
----
TlsCertificateBuildItem item = new TlsCertificateBuildItem("named",
    new MyCertificateSupplier());
----

The certificate supplier is a runtime object that is generally retrieved using a recorder method.
Here is an example of a certificate supplier:

[source,java]
----
public class MyCertificateSupplier implements Supplier<TlsConfiguration> {

        @Override
        public TlsConfiguration get() {
            try {
                KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
                ks.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("target/certs/test-registration-keystore.p12"),
                        "password".toCharArray());
                KeyStore ts = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
                ts.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("target/certs/test-registration-truststore.p12"),
                        "password".toCharArray());
                return new BaseTlsConfiguration() {
                    @Override
                    public KeyStore getKeyStore() {
                        return ks;
                    }

                    @Override
                    public KeyStore getTrustStore() {
                        return ts;
                    }
                };
            } catch (Exception e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }
    }
----

== Startup checks

When the application starts, the TLS registry performs some checks to ensure the configuration is correct:

- the key stores and trust stores are accessible
- the aliases are available and accessible in the key stores and trust stores
- the certificates are valid
- the cipher suites and protocols are valid
- the CRLs are valid

If any of these checks fail, the application will fail to start.

[#reloading-certificates]
== Reloading certificates

The `TlsConfiguration` obtained from the `TLSConfigurationRegistry` includes a mechanism for reloading certificates.
The `reload` method refreshes the key stores and trust stores, typically by reloading them from the file system.

NOTE: The reload operation is not automatic and must be triggered manually.
Additionally, the `TlsConfiguration` implementation must support reloading (which is the case for the configured certificate).

The `reload` method returns a `boolean` indicating whether the reload was successful.
A value of `true` means the reload operation was successful, not necessarily that there were updates to the certificates.

After a `TlsConfiguration` has been reloaded, servers and clients using this configuration may need to perform specific actions to apply the new certificates.
The recommended approach is to fire a CDI event (`CertificateReloadedEvent`) that servers and clients can listen to and make the necessary changes:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
TlsConfigurationRegistry registry;

public void reload() {
    TlsConfiguration config = registry.get("name").orElseThrow();
    if (config.reload()) {
        event.fire(new CertificateReloadedEvent("name", config));
    }
}

// In the server or client code
public void onReload(@Observes CertificateReloadedEvent event) {
    if ("name".equals(event.getName())) {
        server.updateSSLOptions(event.tlsConfiguration().getSSLOptions());
        // Or update the SSLContext.
    }
}
----

These APIs provide a way to implement custom certificate reloading.

=== Periodic reloading

The TLS registry does include a built-in mechanism for periodically checking the file system for changes and reloading the certificates.
You can configure periodic reloading of certificates using properties.
The `reload-period` property specifies the interval at which certificates are reloaded, and it will emit a `CertificateReloadedEvent`.

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.tls.reload-period=1h
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.cert=tls.crt
quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.0.key=tls.key
----

For each named configuration, you can set a specific reload period:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.tls.http.reload-period=30min
quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.cert=tls.crt
quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.key=tls.key
----

Remember that the impacted server and client may need to listen to the `CertificateReloadedEvent` to apply the new certificates.
This is automatically done for the Quarkus HTTP server (including the management interface if enabled).

== Using Kubernetes secrets or cert-manager

When running in Kubernetes, you can use Kubernetes secrets to store the key stores and trust stores.

=== Using Kubernetes secrets

To use Kubernetes secrets, you need to create a secret with the key stores and trust stores.
Let's take the following secret as an example:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  tls.crt: ...
  tls.key: ...
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-certs
type: kubernetes.io/tls
----

The easiest way to uses these certificates is to mount the secret as a volume in the pod:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: demo
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: quarkus
  name: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: demo
      app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: quarkus
        app.kubernetes.io/name: demo
        app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          image: ...
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          name: demo
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8443 # Configure the port to be HTTPS
              name: http
              protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /certs
              name: my-volume
      volumes:
        - name: my-volume
          secret:
            defaultMode: 0666 # Set the permissions, otherwise the pod may not be able to read the files
            optional: false
            secretName: my-certs # Reference the secret
----

Then, you can configure the TLS registry to use the certificates:

[source, properties]
----
# ...
# TLS Registry configuration
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.cert=/certs/tls.crt
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.key=/certs/tls.key

# HTTP server configuration:
%prod.quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=http
%prod.quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
----

You can combine this with the periodic reloading to automatically reload the certificates when they change.

=== Using cert-manager

When running in Kubernetes, you can use cert-manager to automatically generate and renew certificates.
Cert-manager will produce a secret with the key stores and trust stores.
So, configuring the TLS registry is the same as when using Kubernetes secrets.
The generated secret uses the following files:

- `tls.crt` for the certificate
- `tls.key` for the private key
- `ca.crt` for the CA certificate (if needed)

To handle the renewal, you can use the periodic reloading mechanism:

[source, properties]
----
# ...
# TLS Registry configuration
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.cert=/certs/tls.crt
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.key-store.pem.0.key=/certs/tls.key
%prod.quarkus.tls.http.reload-period=24h

# HTTP server configuration:
%prod.quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name=http
%prod.quarkus.http.insecure-requests=disabled
----

== Utilizing OpenShift serving certificates

When running your application in OpenShift, you can leverage the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/security/certificates/service-serving-certificate.html[OpenShift serving certificates] to automatically generate and renew TLS certificates.
The Quarkus TLS registry can use these certificates and Certificate Authority (CA) files to handle HTTPS traffic securely and to validate certificates.

=== Acquiring a certificate

To have OpenShift generate a certificate, you need to annotate an existing _Service_ object.
The generated certificate will be stored in a secret, which you can then mount in your pod.

Consider the following _Service_ example:

[source, yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name: my-tls-secret
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: quarkus
  name: hero-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 443
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
  type: ClusterIP
----

The annotation `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` instructs OpenShift to generate a certificate and store it in a secret named `my-tls-secret`. If your service is already running, you can add this annotation with the following command:

[source, shell]
----
oc annotate service hero-service \
     service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=my-tls-secret
----

Next, mount the secret in your pod by updating your _Deployment_ configuration to include a volume and mount the secret:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/version: ...

    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: my-tls-secret  # <1>
          secret:
            secretName: my-tls-secret
      containers:
        - env:

              value: /etc/tls/tls.crt
            - name: QUARKUS_TLS_KEY_STORE_PEM_ACME_KEY
              value: /etc/tls/tls.key

            - name: my-tls-secret
              mountPath: /etc/tls
              readOnly: true
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8443  # <4>
              name: https
              protocol: TCP
----
<1> Define a volume to mount the secret. Use the same name as the secret declared above.
<2> Set up the key store with the paths to the certificate and private key. This can be configured using environment variables or configuration files. Here, we use environment variables. OpenShift serving certificates always create the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` files.
<3> Mount the secret in the container. Ensure the path matches the one used in the configuration (here `/etc/tls`).
<4> Configure the port to serve HTTPS.

By setting the `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.acme.cert` and `quarkus.tls.key-store.pem.acme.key` variables (or their environment variable variant as done above), the TLS registry will use the certificate and private key from the secret. This configures the default key store for the Quarkus HTTP server, allowing it to use the certificate.
For using this certificate in a named configuration, refer to <<referencing-a-tls-configuration>>.

Deploy your application, and it will utilize the certificate generated by OpenShift, making the service available over HTTPS.

=== Trusting the Certificate Authority (CA)

Now that your service uses a certificate issued by OpenShift, you might need to configure your client applications to trust this certificate.
To accomplish this, create a _ConfigMap_ that holds the CA certificate and mount it in the application's pod.

In this example, we'll use a Quarkus REST client, but the same principle applies to any client.

First, create a _ConfigMap_ for the CA certificate.
Start by defining an _empty_ ConfigMap, which will be populated with the CA certificate:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: client-tls-config
  annotations:
    service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle: "true"
----

The `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle` annotation is used to inject the CA certificate into the ConfigMap.
Note that the ConfigMap initially has no data — it is empty.
During its processing, OpenShift injects the CA certificate into the ConfigMap in the `service-ca.crt` file.

Next, mount the ConfigMap by adding a volume and mount it in your _Deployment_ configuration:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-service-client
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
    app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
      app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: ...
        app.kubernetes.io/version: ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-service-client
          image: ...
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 8080
              protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts: # <1>
            - name: my-client-volume
              mountPath: /deployments/tls
      volumes: # <2>
        - name: my-client-volume
          configMap:
            name: client-tls-config
----
<1> Mount the ConfigMap in the container. Ensure the path matches the one used in the configuration (here `/deployments/tls`).
<2> Define a volume to mount the ConfigMap and reference the ConfigMap that receives the CA certificate.

Finally, configure the REST client to use this CA certificate. Consider the following REST client interface:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme;

import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

@RegisterRestClient(baseUri = "https://hero-service.cescoffi-dev.svc", configKey = "hero") // <1>
public interface HeroClient {

    record Hero (Long id, String name, String otherName, int level, String picture, String powers) {
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/api/heroes/random")
    Hero getRandomHero();

}
----
<1> Configure the base URI and the configuration key. The name must be in the format `<service-name>.<namespace>.svc`, otherwise the certificate will not be trusted. Ensure to also configure the `configKey`.

Next, configure the REST client to trust the CA certificate:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.rest-client.hero.tls-configuration-name=my-service-tls # <1>
quarkus.tls.my-service-tls.trust-store.pem.certs=/deployments/tls/service-ca.crt # <2>
----
<1> Configure the `hero` REST client with the TLS configuration named `my-service-tls`.
<2> Set up the `my-service-tls` TLS configuration, specifically the trust store with the CA certificate. Ensure the path matches the one used in the Kubernetes _Deployment_ configuration. The file is always named `service-ca.crt`.

Now, the REST client is configured to trust the certificate generated by OpenShift.

=== Certificate renewal

OpenShift automatically renews the certificates it generates.
When the certificate is renewed, the secret is updated with the new certificate and private key.

To ensure your application uses the new certificate, you can leverage the Quarkus TLS registry's periodic reloading feature.
By setting the `reload-period` property, the TLS registry will periodically check the key stores and trust stores for changes and reload them if needed:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.tls.reload-period=24h
----

You can also implement a custom mechanism to reload the certificates when the secret is updated.
See <<reloading-certificates>> for more information.

== Quarkus CLI commands and development CA (Certificate Authority)

The TLS registry provides CLI commands to generate a development CA and trusted certificates.
This avoids having to use self-signed certificates locally.

[source, shell]
----
> quarkus tls
Install and Manage TLS development certificates
Usage: tls [COMMAND]
Commands:
  generate-quarkus-ca   Generate Quarkus Dev CA certificate and private key.
  generate-certificate  Generate a TLS certificate with the Quarkus Dev CA if
                          available.
----

In most cases, you generate the Quarkus Development CA once, and then generate certificates signed by this CA.
The Quarkus Development CA is a Certificate Authority that can be used to sign certificates locally.
It is only valid for development purposes and only trusted on the local machine.
The generated CA is located in `$HOME/.quarkus/quarkus-dev-root-ca.pem`, and installed in the system trust store.

=== CA, signed vs. self-signed certificates

When developing with TLS, you can use two types of certificates:

 - a self-signed certificate: the certificate is signed by the same entity that uses it. It is not trusted by default. It's generally what we use when we don't have a CA, or don't want to dig too much into TLS. This is not a production setup, and may be used only for development.
- a signed certificate: the certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA is a trusted entity that signs the certificate. The certificate is trusted by default. This is what we use in production.

We could use self-signed certificate when running application locally, but it's not always convenient.
Typically, browsers will not trust the certificate, and you will have to import it manually.
`curl`, `wget`, `httpie` and other tools will also not trust the certificate.

To avoid this, we can use a development CA to sign the certificates, and install it into the system trust store.
Thus, every certificate signed by this CA will be trusted by the system.

Quarkus makes it easy to generate a development CA and certificates signed by this CA.

=== Generate a development CA

The development CA is a Certificate Authority that can be used to sign certificates locally.
Note that the generated CA is only valid for development purposes, and only trusted on the local machine.

To generate a development CA, use the following command:

[source, shell]
----
quarkus tls generate-ca-certificate --install --renew --truststore
----

`--install` installs the CA in the system trust store.
Windows, Mac and Linux (Fedora and Ubuntu) are supported.
However, depending on your browser, you may need to import the generated CA manually.
Refer to the browser documentation for more information.
The generated CA is located in `$HOME/.quarkus/quarkus-dev-root-ca.pem`.

WARNING: When installing the certificate, your system may ask for your password to install the certificate in the system trust store, or ask for confirmation in a dialog (on Windows).

IMPORTANT: On Windows, makes sure you run from an elevated terminal (run as administrator) to install the CA in the system trust store.

`--renew` renews the CA if it already exists.
When this option is used, you need to re-generate the certificates that were signed by the CA, as the private key is changed.
Note that if the CA expires, it will automatically be renewed (without passing `--renew`).

`--truststore` also generates a PKCS12 trust store containing the CA certificate.

=== Generate a trusted (signed) certificate

Once you have installed the Quarkus Development CA, you can generate a trusted certificate.
It will be signed by the Quarkus Development CA, and so trusted by your system.

[source, shell]
----
quarkus tls generate-certificate --name my-cert
----

This generates a certificate signed by the Quarkus Development CA, and so if properly installed / imported, will be trusted by your system.

The certificate is stored in `./.certs/`.
Two files are generated:

- `$NAME-keystore.p12` - contains the private key and the certificate. It's password protected.
- `$NAME-truststore.p12` - contains the CA certificate, that you can used as trust store (for test, for instance).

More options are available:

[source, shell]
----
Usage: tls generate-certificate [-hrV] [-c=<cn>] [-d=<directory>]
       -n=<name> [-p=<password>]
Generate a TLS certificate with the Quarkus Dev CA if available.
  -c, --cn=<cn>       The common name of the certificate. Default is 'localhost'
  -d, --directory=<directory>
                      The directory in which the certificates will be created.
                        Default is `.certs`
  -n, --name=<name>   Name of the certificate. It will be used as file name and
                        alias in the keystore
  -p, --password=<password>
                      The password of the keystore. Default is 'password'
  -r, --renew         Whether existing certificates will need to be replaced
----

When generating the certificate, a `.env` file is also generated making the Quarkus dev mode aware of these certificates.
So, then, if you run your application in dev mode, it will use these certificates:

[source, shell]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
...
INFO  [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) demo 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 999-SNAPSHOT) started in 1.286s. Listening on: http://localhost:8080 and https://localhost:8443
----

Now, you can open the Dev UI using HTTPS: `https://localhost:8443/q/dev`, or issue a request using `curl`:

[source, shell]
----
curl https://localhost:8443/hello
Hello from Quarkus REST%
----

IMPORTANT: If the Quarkus Development CA is not installed, a self-signed certificate is generated.


=== Generating a self-signed certificate

Even if the Quarkus Development CA is installed, you can generate a self-signed certificate:

[source, shell]
----
quarkus tls generate-certificate --name my-cert --self-signed
----

This generates a self-signed certificate, not signed by the Quarkus Development CA.

=== Uninstalling the Quarkus Development CA

Uninstalling the Quarkus Development CA from your system depends on your OS.

==== Deleting the CA certificate on Windows

To delete the CA certificate on Windows, use the following commands from a Powershell terminal with administrator rights:

[source, shell]
----
# First, we need to identify the serial number of the CA certificate
> certutil -store -user Root
root "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
================ Certificate 0 ================
Serial Number: 019036d564c8
Issuer: O=Quarkus, CN=quarkus-dev-root-ca # <-That's the CA, copy the Serial Number (the line above)
NotBefore: 6/19/2024 11:07 AM
NotAfter: 6/20/2025 11:07 AM
Subject: C=Cloud, S=world, L=home, OU=Quarkus Dev, O=Quarkus Dev, CN=quarkus-dev-root-ca

No key provider information
Cannot find the certificate and private key for decryption.
CertUtil: -store command completed successfully.

> certutil -delstore -user -v Root $Serial_Number
----

Replace `$Serial_Number` with the serial number of the CA certificate.

==== Deleting the CA certificate on Linux

On Fedora, you can use the following command:

[source, shell]
----
sudo rm /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/quarkus-dev-root-ca.pem
sudo update-ca-trust
----

On Ubuntu, you can use the following command:

[source, shell]
----
sudo rm /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/quarkus-dev-root-ca.pem
sudo update-ca-certificates
----

==== Deleting the CA certificate on Mac

On Mac, you can use the following command:

[source, shell]
----
sudo security -v remove-trusted-cert -d /Users/clement/.quarkus/quarkus-dev-root-ca.pem
----
