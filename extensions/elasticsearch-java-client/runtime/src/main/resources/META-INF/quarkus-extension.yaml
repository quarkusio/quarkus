  # WARNING: Before leaving preview, we will need to discuss backwards compatibility.
  # These clients are forward-compatible, not backward-compatible, quoting:
  # > The Elasticsearch Java client is forward compatible; meaning that the client supports
  # > communicating with greater or equal minor versions of Elasticsearch.
  # > Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards compatible with default distributions
  # > and without guarantees made.
  # Source: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/introduction.html
  # This means that upgrading the version of the client in Quarkus will force users to upgrade their cluster.
  # We will need to discuss whether this is acceptable and how to mitigate it.
