= {project-name} - Application Initialization and Termination

You often need to execute custom actions when the application starts and clean up everything when the application stops.
This guide explains how to:

* be notified when the application starts
* be notified when the application stops

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 10 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5+

Remember, you need to configure Maven as indicated in the link:maven-config.html[Maven configuration page].

== Solution

We recommend you to follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone https://github.com/protean-project/quickstarts.git`, or download an https://github.com/protean-project/quickstarts/archive/master.zip[archive].

The solution is located in the `application-lifecycle-events` directory.

== Creating the Maven project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn org.jboss.shamrock:shamrock-maven-plugin:{shamrock-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=application-lifecycle-events \
    -DclassName="org.acme.events.GreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello"
----

It generates:

* the Maven structure
* an `org.acme.events.GreetingResource` resource
* an associated test

== Listening for startup and shutdown events

Create a new class named `AppLifecycleBean` (or pick another name) in the `org.acme.events` package, and copy the
following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.events;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;

import org.jboss.shamrock.runtime.ShutdownEvent;
import org.jboss.shamrock.runtime.StartupEvent;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

@ApplicationScoped
public class AppLifecycleBean {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger("ListenerBean");

    void onStart(@Observes StartupEvent ev) {               // <1>
        LOGGER.info("The application is starting...");
    }

    void onStop(@Observes ShutdownEvent ev) {               // <2>
        LOGGER.info("The application is stopping...");
    }

}
----
1. Method called when the application is starting
2. Method called when the application is terminating

[INFO]
====
The events are also called in _dev mode_ between each redeployment.
====

[INFO]
====
The methods can access injected beans. Check the https://github.com/protean-project/quickstarts/blob/master/application-lifecycle-events/src/main/java/org/acme/events/AppLifecycleBean.java[AppLifecycleBean.java] class for details.
====

== Package and run the application

Run the application with: `mvn compile shamrock:dev`, the logged message is printed.
When the application is stopped, the second log message is printed.

As usual, the application can be packaged using `mvn clean package` and executed using the `-runner.jar` file.
You can also generate the native executable.
