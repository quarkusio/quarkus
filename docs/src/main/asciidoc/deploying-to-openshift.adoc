= Quarkus - Deploying on OpenShift

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide covers generating and deploying OpenShift resources based on sane default and user supplied configuration.


== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* roughly 5 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}
* access to an OpenShift cluster (Minishift is a viable option)

== Creating the Maven project

First, we need a new project that contains the OpenShift extension. This can be done using the following command:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=openshift-quickstart \
    -DclassName="org.acme.rest.GreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/greeting" \
    -Dextensions="openshift"

cd openshift-quickstart
----

=== OpenShift

Quarkus offers the ability to automatically generate OpenShift resources based on sane default and user supplied configuration.
The OpenShift extension is actually a wrapper extension that brings together the link:kubernetes[kubernetes] and link:container-image-s2i[container-image-s2i]
extensions with sensible defaults so that it's easier for the user to get started with Quarkus on OpenShift.

When we added the `openshift` extension to the command line invocation above, the following dependency was added to the `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-openshift</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

By adding this dependency, we now have the ability to configure the OpenShift resource generation and application using the usual `application.properties` approach that Quarkus provides.
The configuration items that are available can be found in: `io.quarkus.kubernetes.deployment.OpenShiftConfig` class.
Furthermore, the items provided by `io.quarkus.deployment.ApplicationConfig` affect the OpenShift resources.

=== Building

Building is handled by the link:container-image#s2i[container-image-s2i] extension. To trigger a build:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
----

The command above will trigger an s2i binary build.

=== Deploying

To trigger a deployment:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true
----

The command above will trigger a container image build and will apply the generated OpenShift resources, right after.
The generated resources are using OpenShift's `DeploymentConfig` that is configured to automatically trigger a redeployment when a change in the `ImageStream` is noticed.
In other words, any container image build after the inital deployment will automatically trigger redeployment, without the need to delete, update or re-apply the generated resources.

=== Customizing

All available customization options are available in the link:kubenretes#openshift[OpenShift configuration options].

Some examples are provided in the sections below:

==== Exposing Routes

To expose a `Route` for the Quarkus application:

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.expose=true
----

Tip: You don't necesserily need to add this property in the `application.properties`. You can pass it as a command line argument:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.openshift.expose=true
----

The same applies to all properties listed below.

==== Labels

To add a label in the generated resources:

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.labels.foo=bar
----

==== Annotations

To add an annotation in the generated resources:

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.annotations.foo=bar
----

==== Environment variables

To add an annotation in the generated resources:

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.env-vars.my-env-var.value=foobar
----

The command above will add `MY_ENV_VAR=foobar` as an environment variable.
Please note that the key `my-env-var` will be converted to uppercase and dashes will be replaced by underscores resulting in `MY_ENV_VAR`.

You may also noticed that in contrast to labels, and annotations for environment variables you don't just use a key=value approach.
That is because for environment variables there are additional options rather than just value.

===== Environment variables from Secret

To add all key value pairs of a `Secret` as environment variables:

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.env-vars.my-env-var.secret=my-secret
----

===== Environment variables from ConfigMap

To add all key value pairs of a `ConfigMap` as environment variables:

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.env-vars.my-env-var.configmap=my-secret
----


==== Mounting volumes

The OpenShift extension allows the user to configure both volumes and mounts for the application.

Any volume can be mounted with a simple configuration:

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.mounts.my-volume.path=/where/to/mount
----

This will add a mount to my pod for volume `my-voume` to path `/where/to/mount`

The volumes themselves can be configured as shown in the sections below:

===== Secret volumes

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.secret-volumes.my-volume.secret-name=my-secret
----

===== ConfigMap volumes

[source]
----
quarkus.openshift.config-map-volumes.my-volume.config-map-name=my-secret
----
