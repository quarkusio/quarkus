# ExecutionPlanAnalysisService Java to Kotlin Conversion

## Overview
Successfully converted `ExecutionPlanAnalysisService.java` to Kotlin (`ExecutionPlanAnalysisService.kt`).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Language Conversion
- Converted Java syntax to idiomatic Kotlin
- Used Kotlin's null safety features (`?` operators)
- Replaced Java Collections with Kotlin collections
- Used Kotlin's `when` expressions and other language features

### 2. Constructor Changes
- Converted to Kotlin primary constructor with `val`/`var` properties
- Moved initialization logic to `init` block

### 3. Collection Handling
- Used Kotlin's built-in collection methods (`find`, `any`, `map`, etc.)
- Replaced Java streams with Kotlin collection operations
- Used `emptyList()` and `emptyMap()` instead of creating new instances

### 4. Null Safety
- Added proper null checks with `?.` and `?:` operators
- Used `let` for safe calls
- Fixed `computeIfAbsent` issue that was causing compilation errors

### 5. Companion Object
- Moved static methods to `companion object`
- Added `@JvmStatic` annotations for Java interop

### 6. Data Classes
- Converted `ExecutionInfo` to a Kotlin data class
- Removed manual getter methods (auto-generated by data class)

## Technical Fix
Fixed a compilation error where `computeIfAbsent` lambda could return null but the map expected non-null values. Replaced with manual cache lookup and insertion pattern.

## Verification
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ✅ Nx plugin functionality verified (`nx show projects`)
- ✅ Graph generation working (`nx graph`)
- ✅ End-to-end smoke tests passing (`npm run test:e2e`)
- ✅ No breaking changes to API
- ✅ All core Maven plugin features operational
