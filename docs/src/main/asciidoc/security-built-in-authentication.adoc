= Quarkus - Built-In Authentication Support

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This document describes the Quarkus built-in authentication mechanisms for HTTP based FORM, BASIC and Mutual TLS authentication as well as the proactive authentication.

[[basic-auth]]
== Basic Authentication

To enable basic authentication set `quarkus.http.auth.basic=true`. You must also have at least one extension installed
that provides a username/password based `IdentityProvider`, such as link:security-jdbc[Elytron JDBC].

Please see link:security#identity-providers[Security Identity Providers] for more information.

[[form-auth]]
== Form Based Authentication

Quarkus provides form based authentication that works in a similar manner to traditional Servlet form based auth. Unlike
traditional form authentication, the authenticated user is not stored in an HTTP session, as Quarkus does not provide
clustered HTTP session support. Instead the authentication information is stored in an encrypted cookie, which can
be read by all members of the cluster (provided they all share the same encryption key).

The encryption key can be set using the `quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` property, and it must be at least 16 characters
long. This key is hashed using SHA-256 and the resulting digest is used as a key for AES-256 encryption of the cookie
value. This cookie contains an expiry time as part of the encrypted value, so all nodes in the cluster must have their
clocks synchronized. At one minute intervals a new cookie will be generated with an updated expiry time if the session
is in use.

The following properties can be used to configure form based auth:

include::{generated-dir}/config/quarkus-vertx-http-config-group-form-auth-config.adoc[opts=optional, leveloffset=+1]

[[mutual-tls]]
== Mutual TLS Authentication

Quarkus provides mTLS authentication so that you can authenticate users based on their X.509 certificates.

To use this authentication method, you should first enable SSL for your application. For more details, check the link:http-reference#ssl[Supporting secure connections with SSL] guide.

Once your application is accepting secure connections, the next step is to configure a `quarkus.http.ssl.certificate.trust-store-file`
holding all the certificates that your application should trust as well as how your application should ask for certificates when
a client (e.g.: browser or another service) tries to access one of its protected resources.

quarkus.http.ssl.client-auth=required                                      <3>

quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.paths=/*                              <4>
quarkus.http.auth.permission.default.policy=authenticated
----
<1> Configures a key store where the server's private key is located.
<2> Configures a trust store from where the trusted certificates are going to be loaded from.
<3> Defines that the server should *always* ask certificates from clients. You can relax this behavior by using `REQUEST` so
that the server should still accept requests without a certificate. Useful when you are also supporting authentication methods other than
mTLS.
<4> Defines a policy where only authenticated users should have access to resources from your application.

Once the incoming request matches a valid certificate in the truststore, your application should be able to obtain the subject by
just injecting a `SecurityIdentity` as follows:

[#x509-subject-example]
.Obtaining the subject
[source,java]
----
@Inject
SecurityIdentity identity;

@GET
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public String hello() {
    return String.format("Hello, %s", identity.getPrincipal().getName());
}
----

You should also be able to get the certificate as follows:

[#x509-credential-example]
.Obtaining the certificate
[source,java]
----
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import io.quarkus.security.credential.CertificateCredential;

CertificateCredential credential = identity.getCredential(CertificateCredential.class);
X509Certificate certificate = credential.getCertificate();
----

=== Authorization

The information from the client certificate can be used to enhance Quarkus `SecurityIdentity`. For example, one can add new roles after checking a client certificate subject name, etc.
Please see the link:security-customization#security-identity-customization[SecurityIdentity Customization] section for more information about customizing Quarkus `SecurityIdentity`.

[[proactive-authentication]]
== Proactive Authentication

By default Quarkus does what we call proactive authentication. This means that if an incoming request has a
credential then that request will always be authenticated (even if the target page does not require authentication).

This means that requests with an invalid credential will always be rejected, even for public pages. You can change
this behavior and only authenticate when required by setting `quarkus.http.auth.proactive=false`.
