Enable xref:security-basic-authentication.adoc[Basic authentication] for your Quarkus project and allow users to authenticate with a username and password.

== Prerequisites

* You have installed at least one extension that provides an `IdentityProvider` based on username and password, such as link:{url-quarkusio-guides}security-jdbc[Elytron JDBC].

== Procedure

. Enable Basic authentication by setting the `quarkus.http.auth.basic` property to `true`.
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.basic=true
----

. For testing purposes, you can configure the required user credentials, user name, secret, and roles, in the `application.properties` file.
For example:
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.auth.basic=true
quarkus.security.users.embedded.plain-text=true
quarkus.security.users.embedded.users.alice=alice <1>
quarkus.security.users.embedded.users.bob=bob <2>
quarkus.security.users.embedded.roles.alice=admin <1>
quarkus.security.users.embedded.roles.bob=user <2>
----
<1> The user, `alice`, has `alice` as their password and `admin` as their role.
<2> The user, `bob`, has `bob` as their password and `user` as their role.
+
For information about other methods that you can use to configure the required user credentials, see the xref:security-testing.adoc#configuring-user-information[Configuring User Information] section of the Quarkus "Security Testing" guide.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Configuring user names, secrets, and roles in the `application.properties` file is only suitable for testing scenarios.
If you are securing a production application, always use a database to store this information.

== Next steps

For a more detailed walk-through that shows you how to configure Basic authentication together with Jakarta Persistence for storing user credentials in a database, see the xref:security-basic-authentication-tutorial.adoc[Secure a Quarkus application with Basic authentication and Jakarta Persistence] guide.
