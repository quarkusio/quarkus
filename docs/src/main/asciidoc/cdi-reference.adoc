= {project-name} - Contexts and Dependency Injection

:numbered:
:sectnums:
:sectnumlevels: 4

{project-name} DI solution is based on the http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html[Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java 2.0, window="_blank"] specification.
However, it is not a full CDI implementation verified by the TCK.
Only a subset of the CDI features is implemented - see also <<supported_features,the list of supported features>> and <<limitations,the list of limitations>>.

NOTE: Most of the existing CDI code should work just fine but there are some small differences which follow from the {project-name} architecture and goals.

[[bean_discovery]]
== Bean Discovery

Bean discovery in CDI is a complex process which involves legacy deployment structures and accessibility requirements of the underlying module architecture.
{project-name} is using a simplified bean discovery.
There is only one bean archive with `annotated` bean discovery mode and no visibility boundaries.

The bean archive is synthesized from:

* the application,
* application dependencies that contain a `beans.xml` descriptor or a generated Jandex index (`META-INF/jandex.idx`),
* and {project-name} integration code.

Bean classes that don't have a http://docs.jboss.org/cdi/spec/2.0/cdi-spec.html#bean_defining_annotations[bean defining annotation, window="_blank"] are not discovered.
This behavior is defined by CDI.
But producer methods and fields and observer methods are discovered even if the declaring class is not annotated with a bean defining annotation (this behavior is different to what is defined in CDI).
In fact, the declaring bean classes are considered annotated with `@Dependent`. 

NOTE: {project-name} extension may declare additional discovery rules. For example `@Scheduled` business methods are registered even if the declaring class is not annotated with a bean defining annotation.


== Private Members

{project-name} is designed with Substrate VM in mind.
One of the limitations is the usage of https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/LIMITATIONS.md#user-content-reflection[Reflection, window="_blank"].
Substrate VM does support reflective calls but for a price of a bigger native image.
{project-name} must use reflection fallback to access private members.
That's why {project-name} users are encouraged __not to use private members__ in their beans.
This involves injection fields, constructors and initializers, observer methods, producer methods and fields, disposers and interceptor methods.

You can use for example package-private modifiers:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CounterBean {

    @Inject
    CounterService counterService; // <1>
    
    void onMessage(@Observes Event msg) { // <2>
    }
}
----
1. A package-private injection field
2. A package-private observer method

Or constructor injection:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CounterBean {

    private final CounterService service;

    CounterBean() { // <1>
    }

    @Inject
    CounterBean(CounterService service) { <2>
      this.service = service;
    }
}
----
1. Dummy constructor needed for CDI beans with a normal scope
2. A package-private constructor injection

== Build Time Extension Points

[[portable_extensions]]
=== Portable Extensions

{project-name} incorporates build-time optimizations in order to provide instant startup and low memory footprint.
The downside of this approach is that CDI Portable Extensions cannot be supported.
Nevertheless, most of the functionality can be achieved using {project-name} link:extension-authors-guide.html[extensions].

=== Additional Bean Defining Annotations

As described in <<bean_discovery>> bean classes that donâ€™t have a bean defining annotation are not discovered.
However, `BeanDefiningAnnotationBuildItem` can be used to extend the set of default bean defining annotations (`@Dependent`, `@Singleton`, `@ApplicationScoped`, `@RequestScoped` and `@Stereotype` annotations):

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep
BeanDefiningAnnotationBuildItem additionalBeanDefiningAnnotation() {
    return new BeanDefiningAnnotationBuildItem(DotName.createSimple("javax.ws.rs.Path")));
}
----

NOTE: Bean registrations that are result of a `BeanDefiningAnnotationBuildItem` are unremovable by default. See also <<remove_unused_beans>>.

=== Resource Annotations

`ResourceAnnotationBuildItem` is used to specify resource annotations  that make it possible to resolve non-CDI injection points, such as Java EE resources.

NOTE: An integrator must also provide a corresponding `org.jboss.quarkus.arc.ResourceReferenceProvider` implementation. 

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep
void setupResourceInjection(BuildProducer<ResourceAnnotationBuildItem> resourceAnnotations, BuildProducer<GeneratedResourceBuildItem> resources) {
    resources.produce(new GeneratedResourceBuildItem("META-INF/services/org.jboss.quarkus.arc.ResourceReferenceProvider",
        JPAResourceReferenceProvider.class.getName().getBytes()));
    resourceAnnotations.produce(new ResourceAnnotationBuildItem(DotName.createSimple(PersistenceContext.class.getName())));
}
----

=== Additional Beans

`AdditionalBeanBuildItem` is used to specify additional bean classes to be analyzed during discovery.
Additional bean classes are transparently added to the application index processed by the container.

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep
List<AdditionalBeanBuildItem> additionalBeans() {
     return Arrays.asList(
          new AdditionalBeanBuildItem(SmallRyeHealthReporter.class),
          new AdditionalBeanBuildItem(HealthServlet.class));
}
----

NOTE: A bean registration that is a result of an `AdditionalBeanBuildItem` is removable by default. See also <<remove_unused_beans>>.

=== Synthetic Beans

Sometimes it's useful to register a synthetic bean, i.e. a bean that doesn't need to have a corresponding java class.
In CDI this could be achieved using `AfterBeanDiscovery.addBean()` methods.
In {project-name} we produce a `BeanRegistrarBuildItem` and leverage the `org.jboss.quarkus.arc.processor.BeanConfigurator` API to build a synthetic bean definition.

// TODO add example

NOTE: The output of a `BeanConfigurator` is recorded as bytecode. Therefore there are some limitations in how a synthetic bean instance is created. See also `BeanConfigurator.creator()` methods.

=== Annotation Transformations

A very common task is to override the annotations found on the bean classes.
For example you might want to add an interceptor binding to a specific bean class.
Here is how to do it - use the `AnnotationsTransformerBuildItem`:

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep
AnnotationsTransformerBuildItem transform() {
    return new AnnotationsTransformerBuildItem(new AnnotationsTransformer() {

        public boolean appliesTo(org.jboss.jandex.AnnotationTarget.Kind kind) {
            return kind == org.jboss.jandex.AnnotationTarget.Kind.CLASS;
        }

        public void transform(TransformationContext context) {
            if (contex.getTarget().asClass().name().toString().equals("com.foo.Bar")) {
                context.transform().add(MyInterceptorBinding.class).done();
            }
        }
    });
}
----

=== Bean Deployment Validation

Once the bean deployment is ready an extenion can perform additional validations and inspect the found beans, observers and injection points.
Register a `BeanDeploymentValidatorBuildItem`:

[source,java]
----
@BuildStep
BeanDeploymentValidatorBuildItem beanDeploymentValidator() {
    return new BeanDeploymentValidatorBuildItem(new BeanDeploymentValidator() {
         public void validate(ValidationContext validationContext) {
             for (InjectionPointInfo injectionPoint : validationContext.get(Key.INJECTION_POINTS)) {
                 System.out.println("Injection point: " + injectionPoint);
             }
         }
    });
}
----

NOTE: See also `org.jboss.quarkus.arc.processor.BuildExtension.Key` to discover the available metadata.

[[remove_unused_beans]]
== Removing Unused Beans

The container attempts to remove all unused beans during build by default.
This optimization can be disabled: `quarkus.arc.remove-unused-beans=false`.

An unused bean:

* is not a built-in bean or an interceptor,
* is not eligible for injection to any injection point,
* is not excluded by any extension,
* does not have a name,
* does not declare an observer,
* does not declare any producer which is eligible for injection to any injection point,
* is not directly eligible for injection into any `javax.enterprise.inject.Instance` injection point
 
The extensions can eliminate possible false positives by producing `UnremovableBeanBuildItem`.
