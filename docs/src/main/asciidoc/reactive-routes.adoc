= Using Reactive Routes

include::./attributes.adoc[]

Reactive routes propose an alternative approach to implement HTTP endpoints where you declare and chain _routes_.
This approach became very popular in the JavaScript world, with frameworks like Express.Js or Hapi.
Quarkus also offers the possibility to use reactive routes.
You can implement REST API with routes only or combine them with JAX-RS resources and servlets.

The code presented in this guide is available in this {quickstarts-base-url}[Github repository] under the {quickstarts-tree-url}/reactive-routes-quickstart[`reactive-routes-quickstart` directory]

== Quarkus HTTP

Before going further, let's have a look at the HTTP layer of Quarkus.
Quarkus HTTP support is based on a non-blocking and reactive engine (Eclipse Vert.x and Netty).
All the HTTP requests your application receive are handled by _event loops_ (IO Thread) and then are routed towards the code that manages the request.
Depending on the destination, it can invoke the code managing the request on a worker thread (Servlet, Jax-RS) or use the IO Thread (reactive route).
Note that because of this, a reactive route must be non-blocking or explicitly declare its blocking nature (which would result by being called on a worker thread).

== Declaring reactive routes

The first way to use reactive routes is to use the `@Route` annotation.
To have access to this annotation, you need to add the `quarkus-vertx-web` extension:

In your `pom.xml` file, add:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-vertx-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Then in a _bean_, you can use the `@Route` annotation as follows:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.reactive.routes;

import io.quarkus.vertx.web.Route;
import io.quarkus.vertx.web.RoutingExchange;
import io.vertx.core.http.HttpMethod;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped <1>
public class MyDeclarativeRoutes {

    // neither path nor regex is set - match a path derived from the method name
    @Route(methods = HttpMethod.GET) <2> 
    void hello(RoutingContext rc) { <3>
        rc.response().end("hello");
    }

    @Route(path = "/greetings", methods = HttpMethod.GET)
    void greetings(RoutingExchange ex) { <4>
        ex.ok("hello " + ex.getParam("name").orElse("world"));
    }
}
----

<1> If there is a reactive route found on a class with no scope annotation then `@javax.inject.Singleton` is added automatically.
<2> The `@Route` annotation indicates that the method is a reactive route. Again, by default, the code contained in the method must not block.
<3> The method gets a https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/ext/web/RoutingContext.html[`RoutingContext`] as a parameter. From the `RoutingContext` you can retrieve the HTTP request (using `request()`) and write the response using `response().end(...)`.
<4> `RoutingExchange` is a convenient wrapper of `RoutingContext` which provides some useful methods.

More details about using the `RoutingContext` is available in the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/[Vert.x Web documentation].

The `@Route` annotation allows to configure:

* The `path` - for routing by path, using the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_capturing_path_parameters[Vert.x Web format]
* The `regex` - for routing with regular expressions, see https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_routing_with_regular_expressions[for more details]
* The `methods` - the HTTP verb triggering the route such as `GET`, `POST`...
* The `type` - it can be _normal_ (non-blocking), _blocking_ (method dispatched on a worker thread), or _failure_ to indicate that this route is called on failures
* The `order` - the order of the route when several routes are involved in handling the incoming request.
Must be positive for regular user routes.
* The produced and consumed mime types using `produces`, and `consumes`

For instance, you can declare a blocking route as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Route(methods = HttpMethod.POST, path = "/post", type = Route.HandlerType.BLOCKING)
public void blocking(RoutingContext rc) {
    // ...
}
----

You can also declare several routes for a single method using `@Routes`:

[source,java]
----
@Route(path = "/first")
@Route(path = "/second")
public void route(RoutingContext rc) {
    // ...
}
----

Each route can use different paths, methods...


=== Handling conflicting routes

You may end up with multiple routes matching a given path.
In the following example, both route matches `/accounts/me`:

[source, java]
----
@Route(path = "/accounts/:id", methods = HttpMethod.GET)
void getAccount(RoutingContext ctx) {
  ...
}

@Route(path = "/accounts/me", methods = HttpMethod.GET)
void getCurrentUserAccount(RoutingContext ctx) {
  ...
}
----

As a consequence, the result is not the expected one as the first route is called with the path parameter `id` set to `me`.
To avoid the conflict, use the `order` attribute:

[source, java]
----
@Route(path = "/accounts/:id", methods = HttpMethod.GET, order = 2)
void getAccount(RoutingContext ctx) {
  ...
}

@Route(path = "/accounts/me", methods = HttpMethod.GET, order = 1)
void getCurrentUserAccount(RoutingContext ctx) {
  ...
}
----

By giving a lower order to the second route, it gets evaluated first.
If the request path matches, it is invoked, otherwise the other routes are evaluated.

=== `@RouteBase`

This annotation can be used to configure some defaults for reactive routes declared on a class.

[source,java]
----
@RouteBase(path = "simple", produces = "text/plain") <1>
public class SimpleRoutes {

    @Route(path = "ping") // the final path is /simple/ping
    void ping(RoutingContext rc) {
        rc.response().end("pong");
    }
}
----
<1> The `path` value is used as a prefix for any route method declared on the class where `Route#path()` is used. The `produces` value is used for content-based routing for all routes where `Route#produces()` is empty.

=== Returning Unis

In a reactive route, you can return a `Uni` directly:

[source,java]
----
@Route(path = "/hello")
Uni<String> hello(RoutingContext context) {
    return Uni.createFrom().item("Hello world!");
}

@Route(path = "/person")
Uni<Person> getPerson(RoutingContext context) {
    return Uni.createFrom().item(() -> new Person("neo", 12345));
}
----

Returning `Unis` is convenient when using a reactive client:

[source,java]
----
@Route(path = "/mail")
Uni<Void> sendEmail(RoutingContext context) {
    return mailer.send(...);
}
----

The item produced by the returned `Uni` can be:

* a string - written into the HTTP response directly
* a buffer - written into the HTTP response directly
* an object - written into the HTTP response after having been encoded into JSON.
The `content-type` header is set to `application/json` if not already set.

If the returned `Uni` produces a failure (or is `null`), an HTTP 500 response is written.

Returning a `Uni<Void>` produces a 204 response (no content).

=== Returning results

You can also return a result directly:

[source, java]
----
@Route(path = "/hello")
String helloSync(RoutingContext context) {
    return "Hello world";
}
----

Be aware, the processing must be **non-blocking** as reactive routes are invoked on the IO Thread.
Otherwise, use the `blocking` attribute of the `@Route` annotation.

The method can return:

* a string - written into the HTTP response directly
* a buffer - written into the HTTP response directly
* an object - written into the HTTP response after having been encoded into JSON.
The `content-type` header is set to `application/json` if not already set.

=== Returning Multis

A reactive route can return a `Multi`.
The items are written one by one, in the response.
The response `Transfer-Encoding` header is set to `chunked`.

[source, java]
----
@Route(path = "/hello")
Multi<String> hellos(RoutingContext context) {
    return Multi.createFrom().items("hello", "world", "!");  // <1>
}
----
1. Produces `["hello", "world", "!"]`

The method can return:

* a `Multi<String>` - the items are written one by one in a JSON Array.
The `content-type` is set to `application/json` if not already set.
* a `Multi<Buffer>` - the buffers are written one by one (one per _chunk_) without any processing.
* a `Multi<Object>` - the items are encoded to JSON written one by one in a JSON Array.
The `content-type` attribute is set to `application/json` if not already set:

[source, java]
----
@Route(path = "/people")
Multi<Person> people(RoutingContext context) {
    return Multi.createFrom().items(
            new Person("superman", 1),
            new Person("batman", 2),
            new Person("spiderman", 3));
}
----

Ths previous snippet produces:

[source, json]
----
[
 {"name":"superman", "id": 1} // chunk 1
 ,{"name":"batman", "id": 2} // chunk 2
 ,{"name":"spiderman", "id": 3} // chunk 3
]
----

=== Event Stream and Server-Sent Event support

You can return a `Multi` to produce an event source (stream of server sent events).
To enable this feature, you need to wrap the returned `Multi` using `io.quarkus.vertx.web.ReactiveRoutes.asEventStream`:

[source, java]
----
@Route(path = "/people")
Multi<Person> people(RoutingContext context) {
    return ReactiveRoutes.asEventStream(Multi.createFrom().items(
            new Person("superman", 1),
            new Person("batman", 2),
            new Person("spiderman", 3)));
}
----

This method would produce:

[source, text]
----
data: {"name":"superman", "id": 1}
id: 0

data: {"name":"batman", "id": 2}
id: 1

data: {"name":"spiderman", "id": 3}
id: 2

----

You can also implement the `io.quarkus.vertx.web.ReactiveRoutes.ServerSentEvent` interface to customize the `event` and `id` section of the server sent event:

[source, java]
----
class PersonEvent implements ReactiveRoutes.ServerSentEvent<Person> {
    public String name;
    public int id;

    public PersonEvent(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public Person data() {
        return new Person(name, id); // Will be JSON encoded
    }

    @Override
    public long id() {
        return id;
    }

    @Override
    public String event() {
        return "person";
    }
}
----

Using a `Multi<PersonEvent>` (wrapped using `io.quarkus.vertx.web.ReactiveRoutes.asEventStream`) would produce:

[source, text]
----
event: person
data: {"name":"superman", "id": 1}
id: 1

event: person
data: {"name":"batman", "id": 2}
id: 2

event: person
data: {"name":"spiderman", "id": 3}
id: 3

----

== Using the Vert.x Web Router

You can also register your route directly on the _HTTP routing layer_ by registering routes directly on the `Router` object.
To retrieve the `Router` instance at startup:

[source,java]
----
public void init(@Observes Router router) {
    router.get("/my-route").handler(rc -> rc.response().end("Hello from my route"));
}
----

Check the https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_basic_vert_x_web_concepts[Vert.x Web documentation] to know more about the route registration, options, and available handlers.


[NOTE]
====
`Router` access is provided by the `quarkus-vertx-http` extension.
If you use `quarkus-resteasy` or `quarkus-vertx-web`, the extension will be added automatically.
====

== Intercepting HTTP requests

You can also register filters that would intercept incoming HTTP requests.
Note that these filters are also applied for servlets, JAX-RS resources, and reactive routes.

For example, the following code snippet registers a filter adding an HTTP header:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.reactive.routes;

import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

public class MyFilters {

    @RouteFilter(100) <1>
    void myFilter(RoutingContext rc) {
       rc.response().putHeader("X-Header", "intercepting the request");
       rc.next(); <2>
    }
}
----

<1> The `RouteFilter#value()` defines the priority used to sort the filters - filters with higher priority are called first.
<2> The filter is likely required to call the `next()` method to continue the chain.

== Conclusion

This guide has introduced how you can use reactive routes to define an HTTP endpoint.
It also describes the structure of the Quarkus HTTP layer and how to write filters.
