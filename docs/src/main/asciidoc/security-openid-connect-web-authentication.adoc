= Quarkus - Using OpenID Connect to Protect Web Applications using Authorization Code Flow.

include::./attributes.adoc[]
:toc:

This guide demonstrates how to use Quarkus OpenID Connect Extension to protect your Quarkus HTTP endpoints using OpenId Connect Authorization Code Flow supported by OpenId Connect compliant Authorization Servers such as https://www.keycloak.org/about.html[Keycloak].

The extension allows to easily authenticate the users of your web application by redirecting them to the OpenID Connect Provider (e.g.: Keycloak) to login and, once the authentication is complete, return them back with the code confirming the successful authentication. The extension will request ID and access tokens from the OpenID Connect Provider using an authorization code grant and verify these tokens in order to authorize an access to the application.

Please read the link:security-openid-connect[Using OpenID Connect to Protect Service Applications] guide if you need to protect your applications using Bearer Token Authorization.

Please read the link:security-openid-connect-multitenancy[Using OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy] guide how to support multiple tenants.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 11+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven {maven-version}
* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq tool]
* Docker

== Architecture

In this example, we build a very simple web application with a single page:

* `/index.html`

This page is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart[directory].

== Creating the Maven Project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart \
    -Dextensions="resteasy,oidc" \
    -DnoExamples
cd security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart
----

If you already have your Quarkus project configured, you can add the `oidc` extension
to your project by running the following command in your project base directory:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="oidc"
----

This will add the following to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Writing the application

Let's write a simple JAX-RS resource which has all the tokens returned in the authorization code grant response injected:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.security.openid.connect.web.authentication;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;

import io.quarkus.oidc.IdToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.RefreshToken;

@Path("/tokens")
public class TokenResource {

    /**
     * Injection point for the ID Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
     */
    @Inject
    @IdToken
    JsonWebToken idToken;

    /**
     * Injection point for the Access Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
     */
    @Inject
    JsonWebToken accessToken;

    /**
     * Injection point for the Refresh Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider
     */
    @Inject
    RefreshToken refreshToken;

    /**
     * Returns the tokens available to the application. This endpoint exists only for demonstration purposes, you should not
     * expose these tokens in a real application.
     *
     * @return a map containing the tokens available to the application
     */
    @GET
    public String getTokens() {
        StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder().append("<html>")
                .append("<body>")
                .append("<ul>");

        Object userName = this.idToken.getClaim("preferred_username");

        if (userName != null) {
            response.append("<li>username: ").append(userName.toString()).append("</li>");
        }

        Object scopes = this.accessToken.getClaim("scope");

        if (scopes != null) {
            response.append("<li>scopes: ").append(scopes.toString()).append("</li>");
        }

        response.append("<li>refresh_token: ").append(refreshToken.getToken() != null).append("</li>");

        return response.append("</ul>").append("</body>").append("</html>").toString();
    }
}
----

This endpoint has ID, access and refresh tokens injected. It returns a `preferred_username` claim from the ID token, a `scope` claim from the access token and also a refresh token availability status.

Note that you do not have to inject the tokens - it is only required if the endpoint needs to use the ID token to interact with the currently authenticated user or use the access token to access a downstream service on behalf of this user.

Please see <<access_id_and_access_tokens,Access ID and Access Tokens>> section below for more information.

== Configuring the application

The OpenID Connect extension allows you to define the configuration using the `application.properties` file which should be located at the `src/main/resources` directory.

=== Configuring using the application.properties file

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/*
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated
----

This is the simplest configuration you can have when enabling authentication to your application. 

The `quarkus.oidc.client-id` property references the `client_id` issued by the OpenID Connect Provider and, in this case, the application is a public client (no client secret is defined).

The `quarkus.oidc.application-type` property is set to `web-app` in order to tell Quarkus that you want to enable the OpenID Connect Authorization Code Flow, so that your users are redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to authenticate.

For last, the `quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated` permission is set to tell Quarkus about the paths you want to protect. In this case,
all paths are being protected by a policy that ensures that only `authenticated` users are allowed to access. For more details check link:security-authorization[Security Authorization Guide].

=== Configuring CORS

If you plan to consume this application from another application running on a different domain, you will need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Please read the link:http-reference#cors-filter[HTTP CORS documentation] for more details.

== Starting and Configuring the Keycloak Server

To start a Keycloak Server you can use Docker and just run the following command:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 8180:8080 {keycloak-docker-image}
----

You should be able to access your Keycloak Server at http://localhost:8180/auth[localhost:8180/auth].

Log in as the `admin` user to access the Keycloak Administration Console. Username should be `admin` and password `admin`.

Import the {quickstarts-tree-url}/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart/config/quarkus-realm.json[realm configuration file] to create a new realm. For more details, see the Keycloak documentation about how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_create-realm[create a new realm].

== Running and Using the Application

=== Running in Developer Mode

To run the microservice in dev mode, use `./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev`.

=== Running in JVM Mode

When you're done playing with "dev-mode" you can run it as a standard Java application.

First compile it:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package
----

Then run it:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----

=== Running in Native Mode

This same demo can be compiled into native code: no modifications required.

This implies that you no longer need to install a JVM on your
production environment, as the runtime technology is included in
the produced binary, and optimized to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compilation will take a bit longer, so this step is disabled by default;
let's build again by enabling the `native` profile:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative
----

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this binary directly:

[source,bash]
----
./target/security-openid-connect-web-authentication-quickstart-runner
----

== Testing the Application

To test the application, you should open your browser and access the following URL:

* http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080]

If everything is working as expected, you should be redirected to the Keycloak server to authenticate.

In order to authenticate to the application you should type the following credentials when at the Keycloak login page:

* Username: *alice*
* Password: *alice*

After clicking the `Login` button you should be redirected back to the application.

== Redirection

When the user is redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to authenticate, the redirect URL includes a `redirect_uri` query parameter which indicates to the Provider where the user has to be redirected to once the authentication has been completed.

Quarkus will set this parameter to the current request URL by default. For example, if the user is trying to access a Quarkus service endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/service/1` then the `redirect_uri` parameter will be set to `http://localhost:8080/service/1`. Similarly, if the request URL is `http://localhost:8080/service/2` then the `redirect_uri` parameter will be set to `http://localhost:8080/service/2`, etc.

OpenID Connect Providers may be configured to require the `redirect_uri` parameter to have the same value (eg. `http://localhost:8080/service/callback`) for all the redirect URLs.
In such cases a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path` property has to be set, for example, `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/service/callback`, and Quarkus will set the `redirect_uri` parameter to an absolute URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/callback` which will be the same regardless of the current request URL.

If `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path` is set but the original request URL has to be restored after the user has been redirected back to a callback URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/callback` then a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect` property has to be set to `true` which will restore the request URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/1`, etc.

[[oidc-cookies]]
== Dealing with Cookies

The OIDC adapter uses cookies to keep the session, code flow and post logout state.

`quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` property is used to ensure the cookies are visible especially when you access the protected resources with overlapping or different roots, for example: 

* `/index.html` and `/web-app/service`
* `/web-app/service1` and `/web-app/service2`
* `/web-app1/service` and `/web-app2/service` 

`quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` is set to `/` by default but can be narrowed to the more specific root path such as `/web-app`.

You can also set a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header` property if the cookie path needs to be set dynamically.
For example, setting `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix` means that the value of HTTP `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header will be used to set a cookie path.

If `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header` is set but no configured HTTP header is available in the current request then the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` will be checked.

If your application is deployed across multiple domains, make sure to set a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-domain` property for the session cookie be visible to all protected Quarkus services, for example, if you have 2 services deployed at:

* https://whatever.wherever.company.net/
* https://another.address.company.net/

then the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-domain` property must be set to `company.net`.

== Logout

By default the logout is based on the expiration time of the ID Token issued by the OpenID Connect Provider. When the ID Token expires, the current user session at the Quarkus endpoint is invalidated and the user is redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider again to authenticate. If the session at the OpenID Connect Provider is still active, users are automatically re-authenticated without having to provide their credentials again.

The current user session may be automatically extended by enabling a `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-expired` property. If it is set to `true` then when the current ID Token expires a Refresh Token Grant will be used to refresh ID Token as well as Access and Refresh Tokens.

=== User-Initiated Logout

Users can request a logout by sending a request to the Quarkus endpoint logout path set with a `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` property.
For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` is set to "/logout" then the logout request has to be sent to `https://application.com/webapp/logout`.

This logout request will start an https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-Initiated Logout] and the user will be redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to logout where a user may be asked to confirm the logout is indeed intended.

The user will be returned to the endpoint post logout page once the logout has been completed if the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` property is set. For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set to "/signin" then the user will be returned to `https://application.com/webapp/signin` (note this URI must be registered as a valid `post_logout_redirect_uri` in the OpenID Connect Provider).

If the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set then a `q_post_logout` cookie will be created and a matching `state` query parameter will be added to the logout redirect URI and the OpenID Connect Provider will return this `state` once the logout has been completed. It is recommended for the Quarkus `web-app` applications to check that a `state` query parameter matches the value of the `q_post_logout` cookie which can be done for example in a JAX-RS filter.

Note that a cookie name will vary when using link:security-openid-connect-multitenancy[OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy]. For example, it will be named `q_post_logout_tenant_1` for a tenant with a `tenant_1` id, etc.

Here is an example of how to configure an RP initiated logout flow:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app

quarkus.oidc.tenant-logout.logout.path=/logout
quarkus.oidc.tenant-logout.logout.post-logout-path=/postlogout

# Only the authenticated users can initiate a logout:
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/logout
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated

# Logged out users should be returned to the /welcome.html site which will offer an option to re-login:
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/welcome.html
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=permit
----

You may also need to set `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` to a path value common to all of the application resources which is `/` in this example.
See <<oidc-cookies, Dealing with Cookies>> for more information.

[[access_id_and_access_tokens]]
== Accessing ID and Access Tokens

OIDC Code Authentication Mechanism acquires three tokens during the authorization code flow: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[IDToken], Access Token and Refresh Token.

ID Token is always a JWT token and is used to represent a user authentication with the JWT claims.
One can access ID Token claims by injecting `JsonWebToken` with an `IdToken` qualifier:

[source, java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.IdToken;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    @IdToken
    JsonWebToken idToken;

    @GET
    public String getUserName() {
        return idToken.getName();
    }
}
----

Access Token is usually used by the OIDC `web-app` application to access other endpoints on behalf of the currently logged in user. The raw access token can be accessed as follows:

[source, java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.AccessTokenCredential;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    JsonWebToken accessToken;

    // or
    // @Inject
    // AccessTokenCredential accessTokenCredential;

    @GET
    public String getReservationOnBehalfOfUser() {
        String rawAccessToken = accessToken.getRawToken();
        //or
        //String rawAccessToken = accessTokenCredential.getToken();

        // Use the raw access token to access a remote endpoint
        return getReservationfromRemoteEndpoint(rawAccesstoken);
    }
}
----

Note that `AccessTokenCredential` will have to be used if the Access Token issued to the Quarkus `web-app` application is opaque (binary) and can not be parsed to `JsonWebToken`.

Injection of the `JsonWebToken` and `AccessTokenCredential` is supported in both `@RequestScoped` and `@ApplicationScoped` contexts.

RefreshToken is only used to refresh the current ID and access tokens as part of its link:#session_management[session management] process.

[[user-info]]
== User Info

If IdToken does not provide enough information about the currently authenticated user then you can set a `quarkus.oidc.user-info-required=true` property for a https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo] JSON object from the OIDC userinfo endpoint to be requested.

A request will be sent to the OpenId Provider UserInfo endpoint using the access token returned with the authorization code grant response and an `io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo` (a simple `javax.json.JsonObject` wrapper) object will be created. `io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo` can be either injected or accessed as a SecurityIdentity `userinfo` attribute.

[[config-metadata]]
== Configuration Metadata

The current tenant's discovered link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata[OpenId Connect Configuration Metadata] is represented by `io.quarkus.oidc.OidcConfigurationMetadata` and can be either injected or accessed as a `SecurityIdentity` `configuration-metadata` attribute.

The default tenant's `OidcConfigurationMetadata` is injected if the endpoint is public.

[[token-claims-roles]]
== Token Claims And SecurityIdentity Roles

The way the roles are mapped to the SecurityIdentity roles from the verified tokens is identical to how it is done for the link:security-openid-connect#token-claims-and-securityidentity-roles[bearer tokens] with the only difference being is that https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[ID Token] is used as a source of the roles by default.

Note if you use Keycloak then you should set a Microprofile JWT client scope for ID token to contain a `groups` claim, please see the https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#protocol[Keycloak Server Administration Guide] for more information.

If only the access token contains the roles and this access token is not meant to be propagated to the downstream endpoints then set `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`.

If UserInfo is the source of the roles then set `quarkus.oidc.authentication.user-info-required=true` and `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=userinfo`, and if needed, `quarkus.oidc.roles.role-claim-path`.

Additionally a custom `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` can also be used to add the roles as documented link:security#security-identity-customization[here].

[[token-verification-introspection]]
== Token Verification And Introspection

Please see link:security-openid-connect#token-verification-introspection for details about how the tokens are verified and introspected.

Note that in case of `web-app` applications only `IdToken` is verified by default since the access token is not used by default to access the current Quarkus `web-app` endpoint and instead meant to be propagated to the services expecting this access token, for example, to the OpenId Connect Provider's UserInfo endpoint, etc. However if you expect the access token to contain the roles required to access the current Quarkus endpoint (`quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`) then it will also be verified.

[[session-management]]
== Session Management

If you have a link:security-openid-connect#single-page-applications[Single Page Application for Service Applications] where your OpenId Connect Provider script such as `keycloak.js` is managing an authoriization code flow then that script will also control the SPA authentication session lifespan.

If you work with a Quarkus OIDC `web-app` application then it is Quarkus OIDC Code Authentication mechanism which is managing the user session lifespan.

The session age is calculated by adding the lifespan value of the current IDToken and the values of the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` and `quarkus.oidc.token.lifespan-grace` properties. Of the last two properties only `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` should be used to significantly extend the session lifespan if required since `quarkus.oidc.token.lifespan-grace` is only meant for taking some small clock skews into consideration.

When the currently authenticated user returns to the protected Quarkus endpoint and the ID token associated with the session cookie has expired then, by default, the user will be auto-redirected to the OIDC Authorization endpoint to re-authenticate. Most likely the OIDC provider will challenge the user again though not necessarily if the session between the user and this OIDC provider is still active which may happen if it is configured to last longer than the ID token.

If the `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-expired` then the expired ID token (as well as the access token) will be refreshed using the refresh token returned with the authorization code grant response. This refresh token may also be recycled (refreshed) itself as part of this process. As a result the new session cookie will be created and the session will be extended.

Note, `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` can be important when dealing with expired ID tokens, when the user is not very active. In such cases, if the ID token expires, then the session cookie may not be returned back to the Quarkus endpoint during the next user request and Quarkus will assume it is the first authentication request. Therefore using `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` is important if you need to have even the expired ID tokens refreshed.

You can also complement refreshing the expired ID tokens by proactively refreshing the valid ID tokens which are about to be expired within the `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-token-time-skew` value. If, during the current user request, it is calculated that the current ID token will expire within this `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-token-time-skew` then it will be refreshed and the new session cookie will be created. This property should be set to a value which is less than the ID token lifespan; the closer it is to this lifespan value the more often the ID token will be refreshed.

You can have this process further optimized by having a simple JavaScript function periodically emulating the user activity by pinging your Quarkus endpoint thus minimizing the window during which the user may have to be re-authenticated.

Note this user session can not be extended forever - the returning user with the expired ID token will have to re-authenticate at the OIDC provider endpoint once the refresh token has expired.

=== TokenStateManager

OIDC `CodeAuthenticationMechanism` is using the default `io.quarkus.oidc.TokenStateManager` interface implementation to keep the ID, access and refresh tokens returned in the authorization code or refresh grant responses in a session cookie. It makes Quarkus OIDC endpoints completely stateless.

Note that some endpoints do not require the access token. An access token is only required if the endpoint needs to retrieve `UserInfo` or access the downstream service with this access token or use the roles associated with the access token (the roles in the ID token are checked by default). In such cases you can set either `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.strategy=id-refresh-token` (keep ID and refresh tokens only) or `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.strategy=id-token` (keep ID token only).

If the ID, access and refresh tokens are JWT tokens then combining all of them (if the strategy is the default `keep-all-tokens`) or only ID and refresh tokens (if the strategy is `id-refresh-token`) may produce a session cookie value larger than 4KB and the browsers may not be able to keep this cookie.
In such cases, you can use `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.split-tokens=true` to have a unique session token per each of these tokens.

Register your own `io.quarkus.oidc.TokenStateManager' implementation as an `@ApplicationScoped` CDI bean if you need to customize the way the tokens are associated with the session cookie. For example, you may want to keep the tokens in a database and have only a database pointer stored in a session cookie. Note though that it may present some challenges in making the tokens available across multiple microservices nodes.

== Listening to important authentication events

One can register `@ApplicationScoped` bean which will observe important OIDC authentication events. The listener will be updated when a user has logged in for the first time or re-authenticated, as well as when the session has been refreshed. More events may be reported in the future. For example:

[source, java]
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;

import io.quarkus.oidc.IdTokenCredential;
import io.quarkus.oidc.SecurityEvent;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.AuthenticationRequestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
public class SecurityEventListener {

    public void event(@Observes SecurityEvent event) {
        String tenantId = event.getSecurityIdentity().getAttribute("tenant-id");
        RoutingContext vertxContext = event.getSecurityIdentity().getCredential(IdTokenCredential.class).getRoutingContext();
        vertxContext.put("listener-message", String.format("event:%s,tenantId:%s", event.getEventType().name(), tenantId));
    }
}
----

== Single Page Applications

Please check if implementing SPAs the way it is suggested in the link:security-openid-connect#single-page-applications[Single Page Applications for Service Applications] section can meet your requirements.

If you prefer to use SPA and JavaScript API such as `Fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`(XHR) with Quarkus web applications, please be aware that OpenID Connect Providers may not support CORS for Authorization endpoints where the users are authenticated after a redirect from Quarkus. This will lead to authentication failures if the Quarkus application and the OpenID Connect Provider are hosted on the different HTTP domains/ports.

In such cases, set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.java-script-auto-redirect` property to `false` which will instruct Quarkus to return a `499` status code and `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `OIDC` value. The browser script also needs to be updated to set `X-Requested-With` header with the `JavaScript` value and reload the last requested page in case of `499`, for example:

[source,javascript]
----
Future<void> callQuarkusService() async {
    Map<String, String> headers = Map.fromEntries([MapEntry("X-Requested-With", "JavaScript")]);

    await http
        .get("https://localhost:443/serviceCall")
        .then((response) {
            if (response.statusCode == 499) {
                window.location.assign("https://localhost.com:443/serviceCall");
            }
         });
  }
----

== Cloud Services

=== Google Cloud

You can have Quarkus OIDC `web-app` applications access **Google Cloud services** such as **BigQuery** on behalf of the currently authenticated users who have enabled OpenID  Connect (Authorization Code Flow) permissions to such services in their Google Developer Consoles.

It is super easy to do with https://github.com/quarkiverse[Quarkiverse] https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-google-cloud-services[Google Cloud Services], only add
the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-google-cloud-services/releases/latest[latest tag] service dependency, for example:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkiverse.googlecloudservices</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-google-cloud-bigquery</artifactId>
  <version>${quarkiverse.googlecloudservices.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

and configure Google OIDC properties:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://accounts.google.com
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
quarkus.oidc.client-id={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret={GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}
quarkus.oidc.token.issuer=https://accounts.google.com
----

== Provider Endpoint configuration

OIDC `web-app` application needs to know OpenId Connect provider's authorization, token, `JsonWebKey` (JWK) set and possibly `UserInfo`, introspection and end session (RP-initiated logout) endpoint addresses.

By default they are discovered by adding a `/.well-known/openid-configuration` path to the configured `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url`.

Alternatively, if the discovery endpoint is not available or you would like to save on the discovery endpoint roundtrip, you can disable the discovery and configure them with relative path values, for example:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.discovery-enabled=false
# Authorization endpoint: http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/auth
quarkus.oidc.authorization-path=/protocol/openid-connect/auth
# Token endpoint: http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token
quarkus.oidc.token-path=/protocol/openid-connect/token
# JWK set endpoint: http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/certs
quarkus.oidc.jwks-path=/protocol/openid-connect/certs
# UserInfo endoint: http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
quarkus.oidc.user-info-path=/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
# Token Introspection endoint: http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
quarkus.oidc.introspection-path=/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
# End session endoint: http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/logout
quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=/protocol/openid-connect/logout

[[jwt-claim-verification]]
== JSON Web Token Claim Verification

Please see link:security-openid-connect#jwt-claim-verification[JSON Web Token Claim verification] section about the claim verification, including the `iss` (issuer) claim.
It applies to ID tokens but also to access tokens in a JWT format if the `web-app` application has requested the access token verification.

== Token Propagation
Please see link:security-openid-connect-client#token-propagation[Token Propagation] section about the Authorization Code Flow access token propagation to the downstream services.

[[oidc-provider-client-authentication]]
=== Oidc Provider Client Authentication

`quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProviderClient` is used when a remote request to an OpenId Connect Provider has to be done. It has to authenticate to the OpenId Connect Provider when the authorization code has to be exchanged for the ID, access and refresh tokens, when the ID and access tokens have to be refreshed or introspected.

All the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication[OIDC Client Authentication] options are supported, for example:

`client_secret_basic`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app

or with the secret retrieved from a link:credentials-provider[CredentialsProvider]:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app

# This is a key which will be used to retrieve a secret from the map of credentails returned from CredentialsProvider
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.provider.key=mysecret-key
# Set it only if more than one CredentialsProvider can be registered
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.provider.name=oidc-credentials-provider
----

`client_secret_post`:

quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app

# This is a key which will be used to retrieve a secret from the map of credentails returned from CredentialsProvider
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret-provider.key=mysecret-key
# Set it only if more than one CredentialsProvider can be registered
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret-provider.name=oidc-credentials-provider
----

`private_key_jwt` with the PEM key file:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-file=privateKey.pem
# This is a token key identifier 'kid' header - set it if your OpenId Connect provider requires it
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.token-key-id=mykey
----

`private_key_jwt` with the key store file:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-store-file=keystore.jks
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-store-password=mypassword
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-password=mykeypassword
# Private key alias inside the keystore
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-id=mykey
# This is a token key identifier 'kid' header - set it if your OpenId Connect provider requires it,
# Note it can be different to the `quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-id` value
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.token-key-id=mykey
----

Using `client_secret_jwt` or `private_key_jwt` authentication methods ensures that no client secret goes over the wire.

[[integration-testing]]
== Testing

Start by adding the following dependencies to your test project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.sourceforge.htmlunit</groupId>
    <artifactId>htmlunit</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
            <artifactId>*</artifactId>
       </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-junit5</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[[integration-testing-wiremock]]
=== Wiremock

Add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-test-oidc-server</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Prepare the REST test endpoints, set `application.properties`, for example:

[source, properties]
----
# keycloak.url is set by OidcWiremockTestResource
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-web-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
----

and finally write the test code, for example:

[source, java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.SilentCssErrorHandler;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebClient;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlForm;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlPage;

import io.quarkus.test.common.QuarkusTestResource;
import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import io.quarkus.test.oidc.server.OidcWiremockTestResource;

@QuarkusTest
@QuarkusTestResource(OidcWiremockTestResource.class)
public class CodeFlowAuthorizationTest {

    @Test
    public void testCodeFlow() throws Exception {
        try (final WebClient webClient = createWebClient()) {
            // the test REST endpoint listens on '/code-flow'
            HtmlPage page = webClient.getPage("http://localhost:8081/code-flow");

            HtmlForm form = page.getFormByName("form");
            // user 'alice' has the 'user' role
            form.getInputByName("username").type("alice");
            form.getInputByName("password").type("alice");

            page = form.getInputByValue("login").click();

            assertEquals("alice", page.getBody().asText());
        }
    }

    private WebClient createWebClient() {
        WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
        webClient.setCssErrorHandler(new SilentCssErrorHandler());
        return webClient;
    }
}
----

`OidcWiremockTestResource` recognizes `alice` and `admin` users. The user `alice` has the `user` role only by default - it can be customized with a `quarkus.test.oidc.token.user-roles` system property. The user `admin` has the `user` and `admin` roles by default - it can be customized with a `quarkus.test.oidc.token.admin-roles` system property.

Additionally, `OidcWiremockTestResource` set token issuer and audience to `https://service.example.com` which can be customized with `quarkus.test.oidc.token.issuer` and `quarkus.test.oidc.token.audience` system properties.

`OidcWiremockTestResource` can be used to emulate all OpenId Connect providers.

[[integration-testing-keycloak]]
=== Keycloak

If you work with Keycloak then you can test against a live Keycloak instance by adding the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-test-keycloak-server</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

and configure `maven.surefire.plugin` as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <systemPropertyVariables>
            <!-- or, alternativey, configure 'keycloak.version' -->
            <keycloak.docker.image>${keycloak.docker.image}</keycloak.docker.image>
            <!--
              Disable HTTPS if required:
              <keycloak.use.https>false</keycloak.use.https>
            -->
        </systemPropertyVariables>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

(and similarly `maven.failsafe.plugin` when testing in native image).

And now set the configuration and write the test code the same way as it is described in the <<integration-testing-wiremock, Wiremock>> section above.
The only difference is the name of `QuarkusTestResource`:

[source, java]
----
import io.quarkus.test.keycloak.server.KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager;

@QuarkusTest
@QuarkusTestResource(KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager.class)
public class CodeFlowAuthorizationTest {
}
----

`KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` registers `alice` and `admin` users. The user `alice` has the `user` role only by default - it can be customized with a `keycloak.token.user-roles` system property. The user `admin` has the `user` and `admin` roles by default - it can be customized with a `keycloak.token.admin-roles` system property.

By default, `KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` uses HTTPS to initialize a Keycloak instance which can be disabled with `keycloak.use.https=false`.
Default realm name is `quarkus` and client id - `quarkus-web-app` - set `keycloak.realm` and `keycloak.web-app.client` system properties to customize the values if needed.

[[integration-testing-security-annotation]]
=== TestSecurity annotation

Please see link:security-openid-connect#integration-testing-security-annotation[Use TestingSecurity with injected JsonWebToken] section for more information about using `@TestSecurity` and `@OidcSecurity` annotations for testing the `web-app` application endpoint code which depends on the injected ID and access `JsonWebToken` as well as `UserInfo` and `OidcConfigurationMetadata`.

== How to check the errors in the logs ==

Please enable `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider` `TRACE` level logging to see more details about the token verification errors:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider".level=TRACE
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider".min-level=TRACE
----

Please enable `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder` `TRACE` level logging to see more details about the OidcProvider client initialization errors:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder".level=TRACE
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder".min-level=TRACE
----

== Running behind a reverse proxy

OIDC authentication mechanism can be affected if your Quarkus application is running behind a reverse proxy/gateway/firewall when HTTP `Host` header may be reset to the internal IP address, HTTPS connection may be terminated, etc. For example, an authorization code flow `redirect_uri` parameter may be set to the internal host instead of the expected external one.

In such cases configuring Quarkus to recognize the original headers forwarded by the proxy will be required, see link:vertx#reverse-proxy[Running behind a reverse proxy] Vert.x documentation section for more information.

For example, if your Quarkus endpoint runs in a cluster behind Kubernetes Ingress then a redirect from the OpenId Connect Provider back to this endpoint may not work since the calcuated `redirect_uri` parameter may point to the internal endpoint address. This problem can be resolved with the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.proxy.proxy-address-forwarding=true
quarkus.http.proxy.allow-forwarded=false
quarkus.http.proxy.enable-forwarded-host=true
quarkus.http.proxy.forwarded-host-header=X-ORIGINAL-HOST
----

where `X-ORIGINAL-HOST` is set by Kubernetes Ingress to represent the external endpoint address.

`quarkus.oidc.authentication.force-redirect-https-scheme` property may also be used when the Quarkus application is running behind a SSL terminating reverse proxy.

== External and Internal Access to OpenId Connect Provider

Note that the OpenId Connect Provider externally accessible authorization, logout and other endpoints may have different HTTP(S) URLs compared to the URLs auto-discovered or configured relative to `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` internal URL.
In such cases an issuer verification failure may be reported by the endpoint and redirects to the externally accessible Connect Provider endpoints may fail.

In such cases, if you work with Keycloak then please start it with a `KEYCLOAK_FRONTEND_URL` system property set to the externally accessible base URL.
If you work with other Openid Connect providers then please check your provider's documentation.
