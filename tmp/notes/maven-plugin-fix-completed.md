# Maven Plugin Fix - Project Discovery Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The Maven plugin wasn't showing any projects because it was using the wrong Maven goal. The TypeScript plugin was calling `mvn dependency:tree` instead of the correct custom goal `mvn io.quarkus:maven-plugin:999-SNAPSHOT:analyze`.

## Root Cause
The plugin code in `maven-plugin.ts` was configured to use Maven's built-in `dependency:tree` goal, which only outputs dependency information, not project discovery data. The actual Java Maven plugin we have implements a custom `analyze` goal that generates the Nx-compatible project structure.

## Fix Applied
Changed the Maven command in `maven-plugin.ts` from:
```typescript
const mavenArgs = [
  'dependency:tree',
  '-DoutputType=json',
  `-DoutputFile=${outputFile}`,
  `-Dverbose=${isVerbose}`
];
```

To:
```typescript
const mavenArgs = [
  'io.quarkus:maven-plugin:999-SNAPSHOT:analyze',
  `-Dnx.outputFile=${outputFile}`,
  `-Dnx.verbose=${isVerbose}`
];
```

## Results
- `nx show projects` now correctly lists all 1000+ Maven projects in the Quarkus workspace
- `nx graph --file graph.json` generates a 32MB JSON file with complete project graph
- Plugin correctly discovers and analyzes all Maven projects with their targets and dependencies

## Technical Details
- The Java Maven plugin (`NxAnalyzerMojo`) was already correctly implemented with the `analyze` goal
- The plugin scans all `pom.xml` files and generates Nx-compatible project configurations
- Each project gets proper Maven lifecycle targets (compile, test, package, etc.)
- Cross-project dependencies are resolved using the `^` syntax for Nx
- Framework-specific goals (Quarkus, Spring Boot) are automatically detected

## Performance
- Plugin processes 1000+ projects in the Quarkus workspace
- Generates comprehensive project graph with targets and dependencies
- Caching is implemented for performance optimization
