= Amazon IAM Client
:extension-status: preview

include::./attributes.adoc[]

Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables users to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.

You can find more information about IAM at https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[the Amazon IAM website].

NOTE: The IAM extension is based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html[AWS Java SDK 2.x].
It's a major rewrite of the 1.x code base that offers two programming models (Blocking & Async).

include::./status-include.adoc[]

The Quarkus extension supports two programming models:

* Blocking access using URL Connection HTTP client (by default) or the Apache HTTP Client
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/basics-async.html[Asynchronous programming] based on JDK's `CompletableFuture` objects and the Netty HTTP client.
