:diataxis-type: concept

To protect your web applications, you can use the industry-standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authorization Code Flow mechanism provided by the Quarkus OIDC extension.

== Overview of the OIDC authorization code flow mechanism

The Quarkus OpenID Connect (OIDC) extension can protect application HTTP endpoints by using the OIDC Authorization Code Flow mechanism supported by OIDC-compliant authorization servers, such as link:https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak].

The Authorization Code Flow mechanism authenticates users of your web application by redirecting them to an OIDC provider, such as Keycloak, to log in.
After authentication, the OIDC provider redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code that confirms that authentication was successful. 
Then, the application exchanges this code with the OIDC provider for an ID token (which represents the authenticated user), an access token, and a refresh token to authorize the user's access to the application.

The following diagram outlines the Authorization Code Flow mechanism in Quarkus.

.Authorization code flow mechanism in Quarkus
image::authorization_code_flow.png[alt=Authorization Code Flow, width="60%", align=center]
. The Quarkus user requests access to a Quarkus web-app application.
. The Quarkus web-app redirects the user to the authorization endpoint, that is, the OIDC provider for authentication.
. The OIDC provider redirects the user to a login and authentication prompt.
. At the prompt, the user enters their user credentials.
. The OIDC provider authenticates the user credentials entered and, if successful, issues an authorization code then redirects the user back to the Quarkus web-app with the code included as a query parameter.
. The Quarkus web-app exchanges this authorization code with the OIDC provider for ID, access, and refresh tokens.

The authorization code flow is completed and the Quarkus web-app uses the tokens issued to access information about the user and grants the relevant role-based authorization to that user.
The following tokens are issued:

* ID token: The Quarkus `web-app` application uses the user information in the ID token to enable the authenticated user to log in securely and to provide role-based access to the web application.
* Access token: The Quarkus web-app might use the access token to access the UserInfo API to get additional information about the authenticated user or to propagate it to another endpoint.
* Refresh token: (Optional) If the ID and access tokens expire, the Quarkus web-app can use the refresh token to get new ID and access tokens.

== Using the authorization code flow mechanism

=== Configuring access to the OIDC provider endpoint

The OIDC `web-app` application requires URLs of the OIDC provider's authorization, token, `JsonWebKey` (JWK) set, and possibly the `UserInfo`, introspection, and end session (RP-initiated logout) endpoints.

By convention, they are discovered by adding a `/.well-known/openid-configuration` path to the configured `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url`.

Alternatively, if the discovery endpoint is not available, or you prefer to reduce the discovery endpoint round-trip, you can disable endpoint discovery and configure relative path values, for example:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.discovery-enabled=false
# Authorization endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/auth
quarkus.oidc.authorization-path=/protocol/openid-connect/auth
# Token endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token
quarkus.oidc.token-path=/protocol/openid-connect/token
# JWK set endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/certs
quarkus.oidc.jwks-path=/protocol/openid-connect/certs
# UserInfo endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
quarkus.oidc.user-info-path=/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
# Token Introspection endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
quarkus.oidc.introspection-path=/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect
# End session endpoint: http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/protocol/openid-connect/logout
quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=/protocol/openid-connect/logout
----

Some OIDC providers support metadata discovery but do not return all the endpoint URL values required for the authorization code flow to complete or to support application functions, for example, user logout. 
To work around this limitation, you can configure the missing endpoint URL values locally, as outlined in the following example:

[source, properties]
----
# Metadata is auto-discovered but it does not return an end-session endpoint URL

quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/oidcprovider/account

# Configure the end-session URL locally, it can be an absolute or relative (to 'quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url') address
quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=logout
----

You can use this same configuration to override a discovered endpoint URL if that URL does not work for the local Quarkus endpoint and a more specific value is required. 
For example, a provider that supports both global and application-specific end-session endpoints returns a global end-session URL such as `http://localhost:8180/oidcprovider/account/global-logout`. 
This URL will log the user out of all of the applications that the user is currently logged into.
However, if the requirement is for the current application to log the user out of only the specific application, you can override the global end-session URL, by setting the `quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=logout` parameter.

[[oidc-provider-client-authentication]]
==== OIDC provider client authentication

OIDC providers typically require applications to be identified and authenticated when they interact with the OIDC endpoints.
Quarkus OIDC, specifically the `quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProviderClient` class,  authenticates to the OIDC provider when the authorization code must be exchanged for the ID, access, and refresh tokens, or when the ID and access tokens need to be refreshed or introspected.

Typically, client id and client secrets are defined for a given application when it enlists to the OIDC provider.
All the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication[OIDC Client Authentication] options are supported, for example:

.Example of  `client_secret_basic`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=mysecret
----

Or:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.value=mysecret
----

The following example shows the secret retrieved from a xref:credentials-provider.adoc[credentials provider]:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app

# This is a key which will be used to retrieve a secret from the map of credentials returned from CredentialsProvider
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.provider.key=mysecret-key
# Set it only if more than one CredentialsProvider can be registered
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.provider.name=oidc-credentials-provider
----

.Example of `client_secret_post`

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.value=mysecret
quarkus.oidc.credentials.client-secret.method=post
----

.Example of `client_secret_jwt`, where the signature algorithm is HS256:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret=AyM1SysPpbyDfgZld3umj1qzKObwVMkoqQ-EstJQLr_T-1qS0gZH75aKtMN3Yj0iPS4hcgUuTwjAzZr1Z9CAow
----

.Example of `client_secret_jwt`, where the secret is retrieved from a xref:credentials-provider.adoc[credentials provider]:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app

# This is a key which will be used to retrieve a secret from the map of credentials returned from CredentialsProvider
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret-provider.key=mysecret-key
# Set it only if more than one CredentialsProvider can be registered
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret-provider.name=oidc-credentials-provider
----

Example of `private_key_jwt` with the PEM key file, and where the signature algorithm is RS256:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-file=privateKey.pem
----

.Example of `private_key_jwt` with the keystore file, where the signature algorithm is RS256:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-store-file=keystore.jks
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-store-password=mypassword
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-password=mykeypassword

# Private key alias inside the keystore
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-id=mykeyAlias
----

Using `client_secret_jwt` or `private_key_jwt` authentication methods ensures that a client secret does not get sent to the OIDC provider, therefore avoiding the risk of a secret being intercepted by a  'man-in-the-middle' attack.

===== Additional JWT authentication options

If `client_secret_jwt`, `private_key_jwt` authentication methods are used or an Apple `post_jwt` method is used, then the JWT signature algorithm, key identifier, audience, subject and issuer can be customized, for example:

[source,properties]
----
# private_key_jwt client authentication

quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-file=privateKey.pem

# This is a token key identifier 'kid' header - set it if your OpenID Connect provider requires it.
# Note if the key is represented in a JSON Web Key (JWK) format with a `kid` property then
# using 'quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.token-key-id' is not necessary.
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.token-key-id=mykey

# Use RS512 signature algorithm instead of the default RS256
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.signature-algorithm=RS512

# The token endpoint URL is the default audience value, use the base address URL instead:
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.audience=${quarkus.oidc-client.auth-server-url}

# custom subject instead of the client id :
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.subject=custom-subject

# custom issuer instead of the client id :
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.issuer=custom-issuer
----

===== Apple POST JWT

The Apple OIDC provider uses a `client_secret_post` method whereby a secret is a JWT produced with a `private_key_jwt` authentication method but with the Apple account-specific issuer and subject claims.

In Quarkus Security, `quarkus-oidc` supports a non-standard `client_secret_post_jwt` authentication method, which you can configure as follows:

[source,properties]
----
# Apple provider configuration sets a 'client_secret_post_jwt' authentication method
quarkus.oidc.provider=apple

quarkus.oidc.client-id=${apple.client-id}
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.key-file=ecPrivateKey.pem
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.token-key-id=${apple.key-id}
# Apple provider configuration sets ES256 signature algorithm

quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.subject=${apple.subject}
quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.issuer=${apple.issuer}
----

===== mutual TLS (mTLS)

Some OpenID Connect providers might require that a client is authenticated as part of the mutual TLS  authentication process.

The following example shows how you can configure `quarkus-oidc` to support `mTLS`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.tls.verification=certificate-validation

# Keystore configuration
quarkus.oidc.tls.key-store-file=client-keystore.jks
quarkus.oidc.tls.key-store-password=${key-store-password}

# Add more keystore properties if needed:
#quarkus.oidc.tls.key-store-alias=keyAlias
#quarkus.oidc.tls.key-store-alias-password=keyAliasPassword

# Truststore configuration
quarkus.oidc.tls.trust-store-file=client-truststore.jks
quarkus.oidc.tls.trust-store-password=${trust-store-password}
# Add more truststore properties if needed:
#quarkus.oidc.tls.trust-store-alias=certAlias
----

==== Introspection endpoint authentication

Some OIDC providers require authenticating to its introspection endpoint by using Basic authentication and with credentials that are different to the `client_id` and `client_secret`.
If you have previously configured security authentication to support either the`client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post` client authentication methods as described in the <<oidc-provider-client-authentication,OIDC provider client authentication>>  section, you might need to apply the additional configuration, as follows.

If the tokens have to be introspected and the introspection endpoint-specific authentication mechanism is required, then you can configure `quarkus-oidc`, as follows:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.introspection-credentials.name=introspection-user-name
quarkus.oidc.introspection-credentials.secret=introspection-user-secret
----

==== Redirecting to and from the OIDC provider

When a user is redirected to the OpenID Connect provider to authenticate, the redirect URL includes a `redirect_uri` query parameter, which indicates to the provider where the user has to be redirected to when the authentication is complete.
In our case, this is the Quarkus application.

Quarkus sets this parameter to the current application request URL by default. 
For example, if a user is trying to access a Quarkus service endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/service/1` then the `redirect_uri` parameter is set to `http://localhost:8080/service/1`. 
Similarly, if the request URL is `http://localhost:8080/service/2` then the `redirect_uri` parameter is set to `http://localhost:8080/service/2`.

Some OIDC providers require the `redirect_uri` to have the same value for a given application, for example, `http://localhost:8080/service/callback`, for all the redirect URLs.
In such cases, a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path` property has to be set, for example, `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/service/callback`, and Quarkus will set the `redirect_uri` parameter to an absolute URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/callback`, which will be the same regardless of the current request URL.

If `quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path` is set but you need the original request URL to be restored after the user has been redirected back to a unique callback URL, for example,  `http://localhost:8080/service/callback`, set `quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect` property to `true`.
This will restore the request URL such as `http://localhost:8080/service/1`.

==== Customizing authentication requests

By default, only the `response_type` (set to `code`), `scope` (set to 'openid'), `client_id`, `redirect_uri` and `state` properties are passed as HTTP query parameters to the OpenID Connect provider's authorization endpoint when the user is redirected to it to authenticate.

You can add more properties to it with `quarkus.oidc.authentication.extra-params`. 
For example, some OIDC providers might choose to return the authorization code as part of the redirect URI's fragment, which would break the authentication process.
The following example shows how you can work around this issue:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.authentication.extra-params.response_mode=query
----

==== Customizing the authentication error response

If the user authentication fails at the OIDC authorization endpoint, then the provider will redirect the user back to Quarkus with `error` and `error_description` parameters instead of `code`.
For example, this can happen when an invalid scope or other invalid parameters are included in the redirect to the provider.

In such cases, an HTTP `401`error will be returned by default. 
However, you can instead request that a custom public error endpoint is called to return a more user-friendly HTML error page.
To do this, set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.error-path` property, as shown in the following example:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.authentication.error-path=/error
----

Ensure that the property starts with a forward slash (/) character and the path is relative to the base URI of the current endpoint.
For example, if it is set as '/error' and the current request URI is `https://localhost:8080/callback?error=invalid_scope` then a final redirect will be made to `https://localhost:8080/error?error=invalid_scope`.

It is important to ensure that this error endpoint is a public resource to prevent the user from being redirected to this page to be authenticated again.

=== Accessing authorization data

Let's first discuss how to access information around authorization.

[[access_id_and_access_tokens]]
==== Accessing ID and access tokens
//SJ: new concept topic to describe the different token types and usage proposed in next iteration
The OIDC code authentication mechanism acquires three tokens during the authorization code flow: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[IDToken], Access Token, and Refresh Token.

ID Token is always a JWT token and is used to represent a user authentication with the JWT claims.
You can use this to get the issuing OIDC endpoint, the username, and other information called _claims_.
One can access ID Token claims by injecting `JsonWebToken` with an `IdToken` qualifier:

[source, java]
----
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.IdToken;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    @IdToken
    JsonWebToken idToken;

    @GET
    public String getUserName() {
        return idToken.getName();
    }
}
----

Access Token is usually used by the OIDC `web-app` application to access other endpoints on behalf of the currently logged-in user. The raw access token can be accessed as follows:

[source, java]
----
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken;
import io.quarkus.oidc.AccessTokenCredential;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/web-app")
@Authenticated
public class ProtectedResource {

    @Inject
    JsonWebToken accessToken;

    // or
    // @Inject
    // AccessTokenCredential accessTokenCredential;

    @GET
    public String getReservationOnBehalfOfUser() {
        String rawAccessToken = accessToken.getRawToken();
        //or
        //String rawAccessToken = accessTokenCredential.getToken();

        // Use the raw access token to access a remote endpoint
        return getReservationfromRemoteEndpoint(rawAccesstoken);
    }
}
----

Note that `AccessTokenCredential` is used if the access token issued to the Quarkus `web-app` application is opaque (binary) and can not be parsed to a `JsonWebToken` or if the inner content is necessary for the application.

Injection of the `JsonWebToken` and `AccessTokenCredential` is supported in both `@RequestScoped` and `@ApplicationScoped` contexts.

RefreshToken is used by Quarkusn OIDC to refresh the current ID and access tokens as part of its <<session-management,session management>> process.

[[user-info]]
==== User info

If the ID token does not provide enough information about the currently-authenticated user, you can get more information from the `UserInfo` endpoint.
Set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.user-info-required=true` property for a link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo[UserInfo] JSON object from the OIDC `UserInfo` endpoint to be requested.

A request will be sent to the OpenID Provider UserInfo endpoint using the access token returned with the authorization code grant response and an `io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo` (a simple `jakarta.json.JsonObject` wrapper) object will be created. `io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo` can be either injected or accessed as a SecurityIdentity `userinfo` attribute.

[[config-metadata]]
==== Accessing the OIDC configuration information

The current tenant's discovered link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata[OpenID Connect Configuration Metadata] is represented by `io.quarkus.oidc.OidcConfigurationMetadata` and can be either injected or accessed as a `SecurityIdentity` `configuration-metadata` attribute.

The default tenant's `OidcConfigurationMetadata` is injected if the endpoint is public.

[[token-claims-roles]]
==== Mapping token claims and `SecurityIdentity` roles

The way the roles are mapped to the SecurityIdentity roles from the verified tokens is identical to how it is done for the xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc[Bearer tokens] with the only difference being that https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[ID Token] is used as a source of the roles by default.

[NOTE]
====
If you use Keycloak, set a `microprofile_jwt` client scope for ID token to contain a `groups` claim.
For more information, see the link:https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#protocol[Keycloak Server Administration Guide].
====

But depending on your OIDC provider, roles might be stored in the access token or the user info.

If the access token contains the roles and this access token is not meant to be propagated to the downstream endpoints then set `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`.

If UserInfo is the source of the roles then set `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=userinfo`, and if needed, `quarkus.oidc.roles.role-claim-path`.

Additionally, a custom `SecurityIdentityAugmentor` can also be used to add the roles. For more information, see xref:security-customization.adoc#security-identity-customization[SecurityIdentity customization].

=== Ensuring validity of tokens and authentication data

A core part of the authentication process is ensuring the chain of trust and validity of the information.
This is done by ensuring tokens are trustable.

[[token-verification-introspection]]
==== Token verification and introspection

The verification process of OIDC authorization code flow tokens follows the Bearer token authentication token verification and introspection logic. For more information, see the xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc#token-verification-introspection[Token Verification And Introspection] section of the "Quarkus OpenID Connect (OIDC) Bearer token authentication" guide.

[NOTE]
--
With Quarkus `web-app` applications, only the `IdToken` is verified by default because the access token is not used to access the current Quarkus `web-app` endpoint and is intended to be propagated to the services expecting this access token.
If you expect the access token to contain the roles required to access the current Quarkus endpoint (`quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`) then it will also be verified.
--

[[token-introspection-userinfo-cache]]
==== Token introspection and UserInfo cache

Code flow access tokens are not introspected unless they are expected to be the source of roles.
They will however be used to get `UserInfo`.
There will be one or two remote calls with the code flow access token, if the token introspection and/or `UserInfo` are required.

Please see xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc#token-introspection-userinfo-cache[Token Introspection and UserInfo cache] for more information about using a default token cache or registering a custom cache implementation.

[[jwt-claim-verification]]
==== JSON web token claim verification

Please see xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc#jwt-claim-verification[JSON Web Token Claim verification] section about the claim verification, including the `iss` (issuer) claim.
It applies to ID tokens but also to access tokens in a JWT format if the `web-app` application has requested the access token verification.

==== Further security with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636[Proof Key for Code Exchange] (PKCE) minimizes the risk of authorization code interception.

While PKCE is of primary importance to public OpenID Connect clients, such as SPA scripts running in a browser, it can also provide an extra level of protection to Quarkus OIDC `web-app` applications. 
With PKCE, Quarkus OIDC `web-app` applications are confidential OpenID Connect clients capable of securely storing the client secret and using it to exchange the code for the tokens.

You can enable `PKCE` for your OIDC `web-app` endpoint with a `quarkus.oidc.authentication.pkce-required` property and a 32-character secret which is required to encrypt the PKCE code verifier in the state cookie, as shown in the following example:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.authentication.pkce-required=true
quarkus.oidc.authentication.state-secret=eUk1p7UB3nFiXZGUXi0uph1Y9p34YhBU
----

If you already have a 32-characters client secret then you do not need to set the  `quarkus.oidc.authentication.pkce-secret` property unless you prefer to use a different secret key. This secret will be auto-generated if it is not configured and if the fallback to the client secret is not possible in case of the client secret being less than 16 characters long.

The secret key is required for encrypting a randomly generated `PKCE` `code_verifier` while the user is being redirected with the `code_challenge` query parameter to an OIDC provider to authenticate.
The `code_verifier` is decrypted when the user is redirected back to Quarkus and sent to the token endpoint alongside the `code`, client secret, and other parameters to complete the code exchange. 
The provider will fail the code exchange if a `SHA256` digest of the `code_verifier` does not match the `code_challenge` that was provided during the authentication request.


=== Handling and controlling the lifetime of authentication

Another important requirement for authentication is to ensure that the data the session is based on is up-to-date without requiring the user to authenticate for every single request.
There are also situations where a logout event is explicitly requested.
Use the following key points to find the right balance for securing your Quarkus applications:

[[oidc-cookies]]
==== Cookies

The OIDC adapter uses cookies to keep the session, code flow, and post-logout state.
This state is a key element controlling the lifetime of authentication data.

Use the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` property to ensure that the same cookie is visible when you access protected resources with overlapping or different roots, for example:

* `/index.html` and `/web-app/service`
* `/web-app/service1` and `/web-app/service2`
* `/web-app1/service` and `/web-app2/service`

By default, `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` is set to `/` but you can change this to a more specific path if required, for example, `/web-app`.

To set the cookie path dynamically, configure the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header` property.
Set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header` property.
For example, to set the cookie path dynamically by using the value of the`X-Forwarded-Prefix` HTTP header, configure the property to `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header=X-Forwarded-Prefix`.

If `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path-header` is set but no configured HTTP header is available in the current request then the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` will be checked.

If your application is deployed across multiple domains, set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-domain` property so that the session cookie is visible to all protected Quarkus services.
For example, if you have Quarkus services deployed on the following two domains, then you must set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-domain` property to `company.net`.

* \https://whatever.wherever.company.net/
* \https://another.address.company.net/


[[token-state-manager]]
===== Customizing the cookie with TokenStateManager

OIDC `CodeAuthenticationMechanism` uses the default `io.quarkus.oidc.TokenStateManager` interface implementation to keep the ID, access, and refresh tokens returned in the authorization code or to refresh grant responses in a session cookie.
This makes Quarkus OIDC endpoints completely stateless.

An access token is only required if the endpoint needs to:

* Retrieve `UserInfo`
* Access the downstream service with this access token
* Use the roles associated with the access token, which are checked by default

In such cases, use the `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.strategy` property to configure the token state strategy as follows:
 
|===
|To... |Set the property to ... 
  
|Keep the ID and refresh tokens only
|`quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.strategy=id-refresh-token` 

|Keep the ID token only 
|`quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.strategy=id-token`

|===


If your chosen cookie strategy combines tokens and generates a large session cookie value that is greater than 4KB, some browsers might not be able to handle such cookie sizes.
This can occur when the ID, access, and refresh tokens are JWT tokens and the selected strategy is `keep-all-tokens` or with ID and refresh tokens when the strategy is `id-refresh-token`.
To workaround this issue,  you can set `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.split-tokens=true` to create a unique session token for each token.

`TokenStateManager` encrypts the tokens before storing them in the session cookie.
The following example shows how you configure `TokenStateManager` to split the tokens and encrypt them:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.split-tokens=true
quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.encryption-secret=eUk1p7UB3nFiXZGUXi0uph1Y9p34YhBU
----

The token encryption secret must be at least 32 characters long. 
If this key is not configured then either `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret` or `quarkus.oidc.credentials.jwt.secret` will be hashed to create an encryption key.


Configure the `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.encryption-secret` property if Quarkus authenticates to the OpenId Connect Provider by using one of the following authentication methods:

* mTLS
* `private_key_jwt`, where a private RSA or EC key is used to sign a JWT token

Otherwise, a random key is generated, which can be problematic if the Quarkus application is running in the cloud with multiple pods managing the requests.

You can disable token encryption in the session cookie by setting `quarkus.oidc.token-state-manager.encryption-required=false`.

Register your own `io.quarkus.oidc.TokenStateManager' implementation as an `@ApplicationScoped` CDI bean if you need to customize the way the tokens are associated with the session cookie. 
For example, you may want to keep the tokens in a database and have only a database pointer stored in a session cookie. 
Note that this approach might introduce some challenges if you need to make the tokens available across multiple microservices nodes.

Here is a simple example:

[source, java]
----
package io.quarkus.oidc.test;

import jakarta.annotation.Priority;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Alternative;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

import io.quarkus.oidc.AuthorizationCodeTokens;
import io.quarkus.oidc.OidcTenantConfig;
import io.quarkus.oidc.TokenStateManager;
import io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.DefaultTokenStateManager;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
@Alternative
@Priority(1)
public class CustomTokenStateManager implements TokenStateManager {

    @Inject
    DefaultTokenStateManager tokenStateManager;

    @Override
    public Uni<String> createTokenState(RoutingContext routingContext, OidcTenantConfig oidcConfig,
            AuthorizationCodeTokens sessionContent, TokenStateManager.CreateTokenStateRequestContext requestContext) {
        return tokenStateManager.createTokenState(routingContext, oidcConfig, sessionContent, requestContext)
                .map(t -> (t + "|custom"));
    }

    @Override
    public Uni<AuthorizationCodeTokens> getTokens(RoutingContext routingContext, OidcTenantConfig oidcConfig,
            String tokenState, TokenStateManager.GetTokensRequestContext requestContext) {
        if (!tokenState.endsWith("|custom")) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }
        String defaultState = tokenState.substring(0, tokenState.length() - 7);
        return tokenStateManager.getTokens(routingContext, oidcConfig, defaultState, requestContext);
    }

    @Override
    public Uni<Void> deleteTokens(RoutingContext routingContext, OidcTenantConfig oidcConfig, String tokenState,
            TokenStateManager.DeleteTokensRequestContext requestContext) {
        if (!tokenState.endsWith("|custom")) {
            throw new IllegalStateException();
        }
        String defaultState = tokenState.substring(0, tokenState.length() - 7);
        return tokenStateManager.deleteTokens(routingContext, oidcConfig, defaultState, requestContext);
    }
}

//SJ: In next iteration, propose to recompose Logout information into a new concept topic

==== Logout and expiration

There are two main ways for the authentication information to expire: the tokens expired and were not renewed or an explicit logout operation was triggered.

Let's start with explicit logout operations.


[[user-initiated-logout]]
===== User-initiated logout

Users can request a logout by sending a request to the Quarkus endpoint logout path set with a `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` property.
For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.path` is set to "/logout" then the logout request has to be sent to `https://application.com/webapp/logout`.

This logout request will start an https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-Initiated Logout] and the user will be redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider to logout where a user may be asked to confirm the logout is indeed intended.

The user will be returned to the endpoint post logout page once the logout has been completed if the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` property is set. For example, if the endpoint address is `https://application.com/webapp` and the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set to "/signin" then the user will be returned to `https://application.com/webapp/signin` (note this URI must be registered as a valid `post_logout_redirect_uri` in the OpenID Connect Provider).

If the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` is set then a `q_post_logout` cookie will be created and a matching `state` query parameter will be added to the logout redirect URI and the OpenID Connect Provider will return this `state` once the logout has been completed. It is recommended for the Quarkus `web-app` applications to check that a `state` query parameter matches the value of the `q_post_logout` cookie which can be done for example in a Jakarta REST filter.

Note that a cookie name varies when using xref:security-openid-connect-multitenancy.adoc[OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy]. For example, it will be named `q_post_logout_tenant_1` for a tenant with a `tenant_1` ID, and so on.

Here is an example of how to configure a Quarkus app initiated logout flow:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app

quarkus.oidc.logout.path=/logout
# Logged-out users should be returned to the /welcome.html site which will offer an option to re-login:
quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path=/welcome.html

# Only the authenticated users can initiate a logout:
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.paths=/logout
quarkus.http.auth.permission.authenticated.policy=authenticated

# All users can see the welcome page:
quarkus.http.auth.permission.public.paths=/welcome.html
quarkus.http.auth.permission.public.policy=permit
----

You may also need to set `quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path` to a path value common to all the application resources which is `/` in this example.
For more information, see the <<oidc-cookies,Cookies>> section.

[NOTE]
====
Some OIDC providers do not support link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-initiated logout] specification and do not return an OpenID Connect well-known `end_session_endpoint` metadata property. 
However, this is not a problem for Quarkus because the specific logout mechanisms of such OIDC providers only differ in how the logout URL query parameters are named.

According to the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#RPLogout[RP-initiated logout] specification, the `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-path` property is represented as a `post_logout_redirect_uri` query parameter, which is not recognized by the providers that do not support this specification.

You can use `quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-url-param` to work around this issue. You can also request more logout query parameters added with `quarkus.oidc.logout.extra-params`. For example, here is how you can support a logout with `Auth0`:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://dev-xxx.us.auth0.com
quarkus.oidc.client-id=redacted
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=redacted
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app

quarkus.oidc.tenant-logout.logout.path=/logout
quarkus.oidc.tenant-logout.logout.post-logout-path=/welcome.html

# Auth0 does not return the `end_session_endpoint` metadata property, configure it instead
quarkus.oidc.end-session-path=v2/logout
# Auth0 will not recognize the 'post_logout_redirect_uri' query parameter so make sure it is named as 'returnTo'
quarkus.oidc.logout.post-logout-uri-param=returnTo

# Set more properties if needed.
# For example, if 'client_id' is provided then a valid logout URI should be set as Auth0 Application property, without it - as Auth0 Tenant property.
quarkus.oidc.logout.extra-params.client_id=${quarkus.oidc.client-id}
----
====

[[back-channel-logout]]
===== Back-channel logout

The OIDC provider can force the logout of all applications using the authentification data: this is called back-channel logout.
In this case the OIDC will call a specific URL from each application to trigger that logout.

link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html[Back-Channel Logout] is used by OpenID Connect providers to log out the current user from all the applications this user is currently logged in, bypassing the user agent.

You can configure Quarkus to support `Back-Channel Logout` as follows:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app

quarkus.oidc.logout.backchannel.path=/back-channel-logout
----

The absolute `back-channel logout` URL is calculated by adding `quarkus.oidc.back-channel-logout.path` to the current endpoint URL, for example, `http://localhost:8080/back-channel-logout`. 
You will need to configure this URL in the admin console of your OIDC provider.

You will also need to configure a token age property for the logout token verification to succeed if your OpenID Connect Provider does not set an expiry claim in the current logout token.
For example, set `quarkus.oidc.token.age=10S` to ensure that no more than 10 seconds elapse since the logout token's `iat` (issued at) time.

[[front-channel-logout]]
===== Front-channel logout

link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0.html[Front-Channel Logout] can be used to logout the current user directly from the user agent (e.g. its browser).
It is like <<back-channel-logout,Back-channel logout>> but the logout steps are executed by the user agent like the browser and not in the background by the OIDP provider.
This option is rarely used.

You can configure Quarkus to support `Front-Channel Logout` as follows:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.oidc.client-id=frontend
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app

quarkus.oidc.logout.frontchannel.path=/front-channel-logout
----

This path will be compared against the current request's path and the user will be logged out if these paths match.

[[local-logout]]
===== Local logout

<<user-initiated-logout,User-initiated logout>> will log the user out of the OIDC provider, if it is used as single sign-on, it might not be what you require.
If, for example, your OIDC provider is Google, you will be logged out from Google and its services.
Instead the user might just want to log out of that specific application.
Another use case might be when the OIDC provider does not have a logout endpoint.

By using <<oidc-session,OidcSession>>, you can support a local logout, which means that only the local session cookie is cleared, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;

import io.quarkus.oidc.OidcSession;

@Path("/service")
public class ServiceResource {

    @Inject
    OidcSession oidcSession;

    @GET
    @Path("logout")
    public String logout() {
        oidcSession.logout().await().indefinitely();
        return "You are logged out".
    }
----

[[oidc-session]]
====== Using `OidcSession` for local logout

`io.quarkus.oidc.OidcSession` is a wrapper around the current `IdToken`, which can help to perform a <<local-logout,Local logout>>, retrieve the current session's tenant identifier, and check when the session will expire.
More useful methods will be added to it over time.
[[session-management]]

==== Session management

By default, logout is based on the expiration time of the ID token issued by the OIDC provider. When the ID token expires, the current user session at the Quarkus endpoint is invalidated and the user is redirected to the OIDC provider again to authenticate. 
If the session at the OIDC provider is still active, users are automatically re-authenticated without needing to provide their credentials again.

The current user session can be automatically extended by enabling the `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-expired` property. 
If set to `true`, when the current ID token expires, a refresh token grant will be used to refresh the ID token as well as access and refresh tokens.

[TIP]
--
If you have a xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc#single-page-applications[single page application for service applications] where your OIDC provider script such as `keycloak.js` is managing an authorization code flow then that script will also control the SPA authentication session lifespan.
--

If you work with a Quarkus OIDC `web-app` application, then it is the Quarkus OIDC code authentication mechanism that is managing the user session lifespan.

To use the refresh token, you should carefully configure the session cookie age.
The session age should be longer than the ID token lifespan and close to or equal to the refresh token lifespan.

You calculate the session age by adding the lifespan value of the current ID token and the values of the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` and `quarkus.oidc.token.lifespan-grace` properties. 
[TIP]
--
You use only the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` property to significantly extend the session lifespan, if required. 
You use the `quarkus.oidc.token.lifespan-grace` property only for taking some small clock skews into consideration.
--

When the current authenticated user returns to the protected Quarkus endpoint and the ID token associated with the session cookie has expired, then, by default, the user is automatically redirected to the OIDC Authorization endpoint to re-authenticate. 
The OIDC provider might challenge the user again if the session between the user and this OIDC provider is still active, which might happen if the session is configured to last longer than the ID token.

If the `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-expired` is set to `true`, then the expired ID token (as well as the access token) is refreshed by using the refresh token returned with the initial authorization code grant response. 
This refresh token might also be recycled (refreshed) itself as part of this process. 
As a result, the new session cookie is created and the session is extended.

[NOTE]
--
In instances where the user is not very active, you can use the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` property to help handle expired ID tokens. 
If the ID token expires, the session cookie might not be returned to the Quarkus endpoint during the next user request as the cookie lifespan would have elapsed. 
Quarkus assumes that this request is the first authentication request. 
Set `quarkus.oidc.authentication.session-age-extension` to be _reasonably_ long for your barely-active users and in accordance with your security policies.
--

You can go one step further and proactively refresh ID tokens or access tokens that are about to expire.
Set `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-token-time-skew` to the value you want to anticipate the refresh. If, during the current user request, it is calculated that the current ID token will expire within this `quarkus.oidc.token.refresh-token-time-skew` then it will be refreshed and the new session cookie will be created. This property should be set to a value which is less than the ID token lifespan; the closer it is to this lifespan value the more often the ID token will be refreshed.

You can further optimize this process by having a simple JavaScript function ping your Quarkus endpoint to periodically emulate the user activity, which minimizes the time frame during which the user might have to be re-authenticated.

[NOTE]
--
You cannot extend the user session indefinitely.
The returning user with the expired ID token will have to re-authenticate at the OIDC provider endpoint once the refresh token has expired.
--

[[oauth2]]
=== Integration with GitHub and non-OIDC OAuth2 providers

Some well known providers such as GitHub or LinkedIn are not OpenID Connect but OAuth2 providers which support the `authorization code flow`, for example, link:https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps[GitHub OAuth2] and link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow[LinkedIn OAuth2].
Remember, OIDC is built on top of OAuth2.

The main difference between OpenID Connect and OAuth2 providers is that OpenID Connect providers return an `ID Token` that represents a user authentication, in addition to the standard authorization code flow `access` and `refresh` tokens returned by `OAuth2` providers.

OAuth2 providers such as GitHub do not return `IdToken`, the fact of the user authentication is implicit and is indirectly represented by the `access` token which represents an authenticated user authorizing the current Quarkus `web-app` application to access some data on behalf of the authenticated user.

For OIDC, you validate the ID token as proof of authentication validity whereas in the case of OAuth2, you validate the access token.
This is done by subsequently calling an endpoint that requires the access token and that typically returns user information.
This approach is similar to the OIDC <<user-info,UserInfo>> approach, with `UserInfo` fetched by Quarkus OIDC on your behalf.

For example, when working with GitHub, the Quarkus endpoint can acquire an `access` token which allows the Quarkus endpoint to request a GitHub profile for the current user.

To support the integration with such OAuth2 servers, `quarkus-oidc` needs to be configured a bit differently to allow the authorization code flow responses without `IdToken`: `quarkus.oidc.authentication.id-token-required=false`.

[NOTE]
--
Even though you configure the extension to support the authorization code flows without `IdToken`, an internal `IdToken` is generated to standardize the way `quarkus-oidc` operates. 
You use an `IdToken` to support the authentication session and to avoid redirecting the user to the provider,  such as GitHub, on every request. 
In this case, the session lifespan is set to 5 minutes, which you can can extend further as described in the <<session-management,session management>> section.

This simplifies how you handle an application that supports multiple OIDC providers.
--

The next step is to ensure that the returned access token can be useful and is valid to the current Quarkus endpoint.
The first way is to call the OAuth2 provider introspection endpoint by configuring `quarkus.oidc.introspection-path`, if the provider offers such an endpoint.
In this case you can use the access token as a source of roles using `quarkus.oidc.roles.source=accesstoken`.
If no introspection endpoint is present, you can attempt instead to request <<user-info,UserInfo>> from the provider as it will at least validate the access token. 
To do so, specify `quarkus.oidc.token.verify-access-token-with-user-info=true`.
You also need to set the `quarkus.oidc.user-info-path` property to a URL endpoint that fetches the user info (or to an endpoint protected by the access token).
For GitHub, since it does not have an introspection endpoint, requesting the UserInfo is required.

[NOTE]
====
Requiring <<user-info,UserInfo>> involves making a remote call on every request.
Therefore, you might want to consider caching `UserInfo` data.
For more information, see the xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc#token-introspection-userinfo-cache[Token Introspection and UserInfo cache] section of the "OpenID Connect (OIDC) Bearer token authentication" guide.

Alternatively, you may want to request that `UserInfo` is embedded into the internal generated `IdToken` with the `quarkus.oidc.cache-user-info-in-idtoken=true` property - the advantage of this approach is that by default no cached `UserInfo` state will be kept with the endpoint - instead it will be stored in a session cookie. You may also want to consider encrypting `IdToken` in this case if `UserInfo` contains sensitive data. For more information, see <<token-state-manager,Encrypt tokens with TokenStateManager>>.
====

OAuth2 servers might not support a well-known configuration endpoint.
In this case, you must disable the discovery and configure the authorization, token, and introspection and the userinfo endpoint paths manually.

For well-known OIDC or OAuth2 providers, like Apple, Facebook, GitHub, Google, Microsoft, Spotify, and Twitter, Quarkus can help significantly simplify your application's configuration with the `quarkus.oidc.provider` property.
Here is how you can integrate `quarkus-oidc` with GitHub after you have link:https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app[created a GitHub OAuth application]. Configure your Quarkus endpoint like this:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.provider=github
quarkus.oidc.client-id=github_app_clientid
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=github_app_clientsecret

# user:email scope is requested by default, use 'quarkus.oidc.authentication.scopes' to request different scopes such as `read:user`.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps for more information.

# Consider enabling UserInfo Cache
# quarkus.oidc.token-cache.max-size=1000
# quarkus.oidc.token-cache.time-to-live=5M
#
# Or having UserInfo cached inside IdToken itself
# quarkus.oidc.cache-user-info-in-idtoken=true
----

See xref:security-openid-connect-providers.adoc[OpenID Connect providers] for more details about configuring other well-known providers.

This is all what is needed for an endpoint like this one to return the currently-authenticated user's profile with `GET http://localhost:8080/github/userinfo` and access it as the individual `UserInfo` properties:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;

import io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo;
import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

@Path("/github")
@Authenticated
public class TokenResource {

    @Inject
    UserInfo userInfo;

    @GET
    @Path("/userinfo")
    @Produces("application/json")
    public String getUserInfo() {
        return userInfo.getUserInfoString();
    }
}
----

If you support more than one social provider with the help of xref:security-openid-connect-multitenancy.adoc[OpenID Connect Multi-Tenancy], for example, Google which is an OpenID Connect Provider returning `IdToken` and GitHub which is an OAuth2 provider returning no `IdToken` and only allowing to access `UserInfo` then you can have your endpoint working with only the injected `SecurityIdentity` for both Google and GitHub flows. A simple augmentation of `SecurityIdentity` will be required where a principal created with the internally generated `IdToken` will be replaced with the `UserInfo` based principal when the GiHub flow is active:

[source,java]
----
package io.quarkus.it.keycloak;

import java.security.Principal;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

import io.quarkus.oidc.UserInfo;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.AuthenticationRequestContext;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentityAugmentor;
import io.quarkus.security.runtime.QuarkusSecurityIdentity;
import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomSecurityIdentityAugmentor implements SecurityIdentityAugmentor {

    @Override
    public Uni<SecurityIdentity> augment(SecurityIdentity identity, AuthenticationRequestContext context) {
        RoutingContext routingContext = identity.getAttribute(RoutingContext.class.getName());
        if (routingContext != null && routingContext.normalizedPath().endsWith("/github")) {
	        QuarkusSecurityIdentity.Builder builder = QuarkusSecurityIdentity.builder(identity);
	        UserInfo userInfo = identity.getAttribute("userinfo");
	        builder.setPrincipal(new Principal() {

	            @Override
	            public String getName() {
	                return userInfo.getString("preferred_username");
	            }

	        });
	        identity = builder.build();
        }
        return Uni.createFrom().item(identity);
    }

}
----

Now, the following code will work when the user signs into your application by using Google or GitHub:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.SecurityIdentity;

@Path("/service")
@Authenticated
public class TokenResource {

    @Inject
    SecurityIdentity identity;

    @GET
    @Path("/google")
    @Produces("application/json")
    public String getUserName() {
        return identity.getPrincipal().getName();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/github")
    @Produces("application/json")
    public String getUserName() {
        return identity.getPrincipal().getUserName();
    }
}
----

Possibly a simpler alternative is to inject both `@IdToken JsonWebToken` and `UserInfo` and use `JsonWebToken` when dealing with the providers returning `IdToken` and `UserInfo` with the providers which do not return `IdToken`.

You must ensure that the callback path you enter in the GitHub OAuth application configuration matches the endpoint path where you'd like the user be redirected to after a successful GitHub authentication and application authorization, in this case it has to be set to `http:localhost:8080/github/userinfo`.


=== Listening to important authentication events

You can register the `@ApplicationScoped` bean which will observe important OIDC authentication events.
When a user logs in for the first time, reauthenticates, or refreshes the session, the listener is updated.  
In the future, more events might be reported. 
For example:

[source, java]
----
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.enterprise.event.Observes;

import io.quarkus.oidc.IdTokenCredential;
import io.quarkus.oidc.SecurityEvent;
import io.quarkus.security.identity.AuthenticationRequestContext;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
public class SecurityEventListener {

    public void event(@Observes SecurityEvent event) {
        String tenantId = event.getSecurityIdentity().getAttribute("tenant-id");
        RoutingContext vertxContext = event.getSecurityIdentity().getAttribute(RoutingContext.class.getName());
        vertxContext.put("listener-message", String.format("event:%s,tenantId:%s", event.getEventType().name(), tenantId));
    }
}
----

=== Propagating tokens to downstream services

For information about Authorization Code Flow access token propagation to downstream services, see the xref:security-openid-connect-client-reference.adoc#token-propagation[Token Propagation] section.


== Integration considerations

Your application secured by OIDC integrates in an environment where it can be called from single-page applications, needs to work with well-known OIDC providers, run behind HTTP Reverse Proxy, require external and internal access, etc.
 
This section discusses these considerations.

=== Single-page applications

You can check if implementing single-page applications (SPAs) the way it is suggested in the xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc#single-page-applications[Single-page applications] section of the "OpenID Connect (OIDC) Bearer token authentication" guide meets your requirements.

If you prefer to use SPAs and JavaScript APIs such as `Fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`(XHR) with Quarkus web applications, be aware that OpenID Connect providers might not support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for authorization endpoints where the users are authenticated after a redirect from Quarkus. 
This will lead to authentication failures if the Quarkus application and the OpenID Connect provider are hosted on different HTTP domains, ports, or both.

In such cases, set the `quarkus.oidc.authentication.java-script-auto-redirect` property to `false`, which will instruct Quarkus to return a `499` status code and a `WWW-Authenticate` header with the `OIDC` value.

The browser script must set a header to identify the current request as a JavaScript request for `499` status code to be returned when `quarkus.oidc.authentication.java-script-auto-redirect` property is set to `false`.

If the script engine sets an engine-specific request header itself, then you can register a custom `quarkus.oidc.JavaScriptRequestChecker` bean, which will inform Quarkus if the current request is a JavaScript request. For example, if the JavaScript engine sets a header such as `HX-Request: true` then you can have it checked like this:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

import io.quarkus.oidc.JavaScriptRequestChecker;
import io.vertx.ext.web.RoutingContext;

@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomJavaScriptRequestChecker implements JavaScriptRequestChecker {

and reload the last requested page in case of a `499` status code.

Otherwise you must also update the browser script to set the `X-Requested-With` header with the `JavaScript` value and reload the last requested page in case of a `499` status code.

For example:

[source,javascript]
----
Future<void> callQuarkusService() async {
    Map<String, String> headers = Map.fromEntries([MapEntry("X-Requested-With", "JavaScript")]);

    await http
        .get("https://localhost:443/serviceCall")
        .then((response) {
            if (response.statusCode == 499) {
                window.location.assign("https://localhost.com:443/serviceCall");
            }
         });
  }

=== Cross-origin resource sharing

If you plan to consume this application from a single-page application running on a different domain, you need to configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). 
For more information, see the xref:http-reference.adoc#cors-filter[CORS filter] section of the "HTTP reference" guide.

=== Calling Cloud provider services

==== Google Cloud

You can have Quarkus OIDC `web-app` applications access **Google Cloud services** such as **BigQuery** on behalf of the currently-authenticated users who have enabled OpenID Connect (Authorization Code Flow) permissions to such services in their Google developer consoles.

It is super easy to do with https://github.com/quarkiverse[Quarkiverse] https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-google-cloud-services[Google Cloud Services], only add
the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-google-cloud-services/releases/latest[latest tag] service dependency, for example:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.googlecloudservices</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-google-cloud-bigquery</artifactId>
    <version>${quarkiverse.googlecloudservices.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
implementation("io.quarkiverse.googlecloudservices:quarkus-google-cloud-bigquery:${quarkiverse.googlecloudservices.version}")
----

and configure Google OIDC properties:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.oidc.provider=google
quarkus.oidc.client-id={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret={GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}
quarkus.oidc.token.issuer=https://accounts.google.com
----

=== Running Quarkus application behind a reverse proxy

OIDC authentication mechanism can be affected if your Quarkus application is running behind a reverse proxy/gateway/firewall when HTTP `Host` header may be reset to the internal IP address, HTTPS connection may be terminated, etc. For example, an authorization code flow `redirect_uri` parameter may be set to the internal host instead of the expected external one.

In such cases configuring Quarkus to recognize the original headers forwarded by the proxy will be required, for more information, see the xref:http-reference.adoc#reverse-proxy[Running behind a reverse proxy] Vert.x documentation section.

For example, if your Quarkus endpoint runs in a cluster behind Kubernetes Ingress then a redirect from the OpenID Connect Provider back to this endpoint may not work since the calculated `redirect_uri` parameter may point to the internal endpoint address. This problem can be resolved with the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.http.proxy.proxy-address-forwarding=true
quarkus.http.proxy.allow-forwarded=false
quarkus.http.proxy.enable-forwarded-host=true
quarkus.http.proxy.forwarded-host-header=X-ORIGINAL-HOST
----

where `X-ORIGINAL-HOST` is set by Kubernetes Ingress to represent the external endpoint address.

`quarkus.oidc.authentication.force-redirect-https-scheme` property may also be used when the Quarkus application is running behind an SSL terminating reverse proxy.

=== External and internal access to the OIDC provider

Note that the OpenID Connect Provider externally accessible authorization, logout and other endpoints may have different HTTP(S) URLs compared to the URLs auto-discovered or configured relative to `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` internal URL.
In such cases an issuer verification failure may be reported by the endpoint and redirects to the externally accessible Connect Provider endpoints may fail.

In such cases, if you work with Keycloak then please start it with a `KEYCLOAK_FRONTEND_URL` system property set to the externally accessible base URL.
If you work with other Openid Connect providers then please check your provider's documentation.

[[integration-testing]]
== Testing

Testing is often tricky when it comes to authentification to a separate OIDC like server.
Quarkus offers several options from mocking to a local run of an OIDC provider.

Start by adding the following dependencies to your test project:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.sourceforge.htmlunit</groupId>
    <artifactId>htmlunit</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
            <artifactId>*</artifactId>
       </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-junit5</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
testImplementation("net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit")
testImplementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-junit5")
----

[[integration-testing-wiremock]]
=== Wiremock

Add the following dependency:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-test-oidc-server</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
testImplementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-test-oidc-server")
----

Prepare the REST test endpoints, set `application.properties`, for example:

[source, properties]
----
# keycloak.url is set by OidcWiremockTestResource
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=${keycloak.url}/realms/quarkus/
quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-web-app
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret
quarkus.oidc.application-type=web-app
----

and finally write the test code, for example:

[source, java]
----
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.SilentCssErrorHandler;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.WebClient;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlForm;
import com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.html.HtmlPage;

import io.quarkus.test.common.QuarkusTestResource;
import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import io.quarkus.test.oidc.server.OidcWiremockTestResource;

@QuarkusTest
@QuarkusTestResource(OidcWiremockTestResource.class)
public class CodeFlowAuthorizationTest {

    @Test
    public void testCodeFlow() throws Exception {
        try (final WebClient webClient = createWebClient()) {
            // the test REST endpoint listens on '/code-flow'
            HtmlPage page = webClient.getPage("http://localhost:8081/code-flow");

            HtmlForm form = page.getFormByName("form");
            // user 'alice' has the 'user' role
            form.getInputByName("username").type("alice");
            form.getInputByName("password").type("alice");

            page = form.getInputByValue("login").click();

            assertEquals("alice", page.getBody().asText());
        }
    }

    private WebClient createWebClient() {
        WebClient webClient = new WebClient();
        webClient.setCssErrorHandler(new SilentCssErrorHandler());
        return webClient;
    }
}
----

`OidcWiremockTestResource` recognizes `alice` and `admin` users. The user `alice` has the `user` role only by default - it can be customized with a `quarkus.test.oidc.token.user-roles` system property. The user `admin` has the `user` and `admin` roles by default - it can be customized with a `quarkus.test.oidc.token.admin-roles` system property.

Additionally, `OidcWiremockTestResource` set token issuer and audience to `https://service.example.com` which can be customized with `quarkus.test.oidc.token.issuer` and `quarkus.test.oidc.token.audience` system properties.

`OidcWiremockTestResource` can be used to emulate all OpenID Connect providers.

[[integration-testing-keycloak-devservices]]
=== Dev services for Keycloak

Using xref:security-openid-connect-dev-services.adoc[Dev Services for Keycloak] is recommended for the integration testing against Keycloak.
`Dev Services for Keycloak` will launch and initialize a test container: it will create a `quarkus` realm, a `quarkus-app` client (`secret` secret) and add `alice` (`admin` and `user` roles) and `bob` (`user` role) users, where all of these properties can be customized.

First, prepare `application.properties`. You can start with a completely empty `application.properties` as `Dev Services for Keycloak` will register `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` pointing to the running test container as well as `quarkus.oidc.client-id=quarkus-app` and `quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=secret`.

But if you already have all the required `quarkus-oidc` properties configured then you only need to associate `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` with the `prod` profile for `Dev Services for Keycloak`to start a container, for example:

[source,properties]
----
%prod.quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
----

If a custom realm file has to be imported into Keycloak before running the tests then you can configure `Dev Services for Keycloak` as follows:

[source,properties]
----
%prod.quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:8180/realms/quarkus
quarkus.keycloak.devservices.realm-path=quarkus-realm.json
----

Finally, write a test code the same way as it is described in the <<integration-testing-wiremock,Wiremock>> section.
The only difference is that `@QuarkusTestResource` is no longer needed:

[source, java]
----
@QuarkusTest
public class CodeFlowAuthorizationTest {
}
----

[[integration-testing-keycloak]]
=== Using KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager

Use `KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` for your tests only if there is a good reason not to use `Dev Services for Keycloak`.
If you need to do the integration testing against Keycloak then you are encouraged to do it with <<integration-testing-keycloak-devservices,Dev services For Keycloak>>.

Start with adding the following dependency:

[source,xml,role="primary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-cli asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-maven"]
.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-test-keycloak-server</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[source,gradle,role="secondary asciidoc-tabs-target-sync-gradle"]
.build.gradle
----
testImplementation("io.quarkus:quarkus-test-keycloak-server")
----

which provides `io.quarkus.test.keycloak.server.KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` - an implementation of `io.quarkus.test.common.QuarkusTestResourceLifecycleManager` which starts a Keycloak container.

And configure the Maven Surefire plugin as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <systemPropertyVariables>
            <!-- or, alternatively, configure 'keycloak.version' -->
            <keycloak.docker.image>${keycloak.docker.image}</keycloak.docker.image>
            <!--
              Disable HTTPS if required:
              <keycloak.use.https>false</keycloak.use.https>
            -->
        </systemPropertyVariables>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

(and similarly the Maven Failsafe plugin when testing in native image).

And now set the configuration and write the test code the same way as it is described in the <<integration-testing-wiremock,Wiremock>> section.
The only difference is the name of `QuarkusTestResource`:

[source, java]
----
import io.quarkus.test.keycloak.server.KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager;

@QuarkusTest
@QuarkusTestResource(KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager.class)
public class CodeFlowAuthorizationTest {
}
----

`KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` registers `alice` and `admin` users. The user `alice` has the `user` role only by default - it can be customized with a `keycloak.token.user-roles` system property. The user `admin` has the `user` and `admin` roles by default - it can be customized with a `keycloak.token.admin-roles` system property.

By default, `KeycloakTestResourceLifecycleManager` uses HTTPS to initialize a Keycloak instance which can be disabled with `keycloak.use.https=false`.
Default realm name is `quarkus` and client id - `quarkus-web-app` - set `keycloak.realm` and `keycloak.web-app.client` system properties to customize the values if needed.

[[integration-testing-security-annotation]]
=== TestSecurity annotation

See xref:security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication.adoc#integration-testing-security-annotation[Use TestingSecurity with injected JsonWebToken] section for more information about using `@TestSecurity` and `@OidcSecurity` annotations for testing the `web-app` application endpoint code which depends on the injected ID and access `JsonWebToken` as well as `UserInfo` and `OidcConfigurationMetadata`.

=== Checking errors in the logs

To see details about the token verification errors, you must enable `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider` `TRACE` level logging:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider".level=TRACE
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcProvider".min-level=TRACE
----

To see details about the OidcProvider client initialization errors, enable `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder` `TRACE` level logging:

[source, properties]
----
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder".level=TRACE
quarkus.log.category."io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.OidcRecorder".min-level=TRACE
----

You can also from `quarkus dev` console hit `j` to change the application global log level.
