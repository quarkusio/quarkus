/**
 * Identifies a method of a bean class that is automatically scheduled and invoked by the container.
 * <p>
 * A scheduled method is a non-abstract non-private method of a bean class. It may be either static or non-static.
 * <p>
 * The schedule is defined either by {@link #cron()} or by {@link #every()} attribute. If both are specified, the cron
 * expression takes precedence.
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;ApplicationScoped
 * class MyService {
 *
 *     &#64;Scheduled(cron = "0/5 * * * * ?")
 *     void check() {
 *         // do something important every 5 seconds
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The annotated method must return {@code void}, {@code java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage<Void>} or
 * {@code io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni<Void>} and either declare no parameters or one parameter of type
 * {@link ScheduledExecution}.
 * <p>
 * By default, a scheduled method is executed on the main executor for blocking tasks. However, a scheduled method that returns
 * {@code java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage<Void>} or {@code io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni<Void>}, or is annotated with
 * {@link io.smallrye.common.annotation.NonBlocking} is executed on the event loop.
