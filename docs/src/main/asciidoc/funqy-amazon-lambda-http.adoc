= Funqy HTTP Binding with Amazon Lambda 
:extension-status: preview

include::./attributes.adoc[]

If you want to allow HTTP clients to invoke on your Funqy functions on AWS Lambda, Quarkus allows you to expose multiple
Funqy functions through HTTP deployed as one AWS Lambda.  This approach does add overhead over the
regular Funqy AWS Lambda integration and also requires you to use AWS API Gateway.

include::./status-include.adoc[]

Follow the xref:amazon-lambda-http.adoc[Amazon Lambda Http Guide].  It walks through using a variety of HTTP
frameworks on Amazon Lambda, including Funqy.

WARNING: The Funqy HTTP + AWS Lambda binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy
needs to be portable across a lot of different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding
is very minimalistic and you will lose REST features like linking and the ability to leverage
HTTP features like cache-control and conditional GETs.  You may want to consider using Quarkus's
JAX-RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route xref:amazon-lambda-http.adoc[support] instead.  They also work with Quarkus and AWS Lambda.

== An additional Quickstart

Beyond generating an AWS project that is covered in the xref:amazon-lambda-http.adoc[Amazon Lambda Http Guide],
there's also a quickstart for running Funqy HTTP on AWS Lambda.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `funqy-amazon-lambda-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/funqy-quickstarts/funqy-amazon-lambda-http-quickstart[directory].

== The Code

There is nothing special about the code and more importantly nothing AWS specific.  Funqy functions can be deployed to many different
environments and AWS Lambda is one of them.  The Java code is actually the same exact code as the {quickstarts-tree-url}/funqy-quickstarts/funqy-http-quickstart[funqy-http-quickstart].

== Getting Started

The steps to get this quickstart running are exactly the same as defined in the xref:amazon-lambda-http.adoc[Amazon Lambda HTTP Guide].
This differences are that you are running from a quickstart and the maven dependencies are slightly different.
