= Funqy HTTP Binding with Google Cloud Functions
:extension-status: preview
include::_attributes.adoc[]
:categories: cloud
:summary: This guide explains Funqy's Google Cloud Platform Functions HTTP binding.

If you want to allow HTTP clients to invoke your Funqy functions on Google Cloud Functions, Quarkus allows you to expose multiple
Funqy functions through HTTP deployed as one Google Cloud Function.  This approach does add overhead over the
regular Funqy Google Cloud Function integration.

include::{includes}/extension-status.adoc[]

Follow the xref:gcp-functions-http.adoc[Google Cloud Functions Http Guide].  It walks through using a variety of HTTP
frameworks on Google Cloud Functions, including Funqy.

WARNING: The Funqy HTTP + Google Cloud Functions binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy
needs to be portable across a lot of different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding
is very minimalistic and you will lose REST features like linking and the ability to leverage
HTTP features like cache-control and conditional GETs.  You may want to consider using Quarkus's
JAX-RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route xref:gcp-functions-http.adoc[support] instead.  They also work with Quarkus and Google Cloud Functions.

== An additional Quickstart

Beyond generating a Google Cloud Functions project that is covered in the xref:gcp-functions-http.adoc[Google Cloud Functions HTTP Guide],
there's also a quickstart for running Funqy HTTP on Google Cloud Functions.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `funqy-google-cloud-functions-http-quickstart` {quickstarts-tree-url}/funqy-quickstarts/funqy-google-cloud-functions-http-quickstart[directory].

== The Code

There is nothing special about the code and more importantly nothing Google Cloud specific.  Funqy functions can be deployed to many
environments and Google Cloud Functions is one of them.  The Java code is actually the same exact code as the {quickstarts-tree-url}/funqy-quickstarts/funqy-http-quickstart[funqy-http-quickstart].

== Getting Started

The steps to get this quickstart running are exactly the same as defined in the xref:gcp-functions-http.adoc[Google Cloud Functions HTTP Guide].
These differences are that you are running from a quickstart and the Maven dependencies are slightly different.
