Quarkus Security is a framework that provides the architecture, multiple authentication and authorization mechanisms, and other tools for you to build secure and production-quality Java applications.

Before you start building security into your Quarkus applications, learn about the xref:security-architecture-concept.adoc[Quarkus Security architecture] and the different authentication mechanisms and features that you can use.

== Key features of Quarkus Security

The Quarkus Security framework provides built-in security mechanisms for Basic, form-based, and mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
You can also integrate Quarkus with several well-known security xref:security-authentication-mechanisms-concept.adoc#other-supported-authentication-mechanisms[authentication mechanisms] and protocols.

{project-name} also includes built-in security to allow for role-based Access control (RBAC) based on the common security annotations @RolesAllowed, @DenyAll, @PermitAll on REST endpoints and CDI beans. 
For more information, see xref:security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference.adoc[Authorization of web endpoints].

Quarkus Security also supports the following features:

* xref:security-proactive-authentication-concept.adoc[Proactive authentication]
* xref:security-identity-providers-concept.adoc[Identity providers]
* xref:http-reference.adoc#ssl[Secure connections with SSL/TLS]
* <<Cross-origin resource sharing>>
* <<Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention>>
* <<SameSite cookies>>
* <<Secret engines>>
* <<Secure serialization>>
* <<Secure auto-generated resources by REST Data with Panache>>
* <<US National Vulnerability Database registration>>

Quarkus Security is also highly customizable. For more information, see xref:security-customization.adoc[Security customization].

== Getting started with Quarkus Security

To get started with security in Quarkus, we recommend you combine the Quarkus built-in xref:security-basic-authentication-concept.adoc[Basic authentication] with the JPA identity provider to enable role-based access control (RBAC).
Complete the steps in the xref:security-basic-authentication-tutorial.adoc[Secure a Quarkus application with Basic authentication] tutorial.

After you have successfully secured your Quarkus application with Basic authentication, you can increase the security further by adding more advanced authentication mechanisms, for example, OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.

//Add a link to the recomposed OIDC intro concept here.

== Quarkus Security testing

Guidance for testing Quarkus Security features and ensuring that your Quarkus applications are securely protected is provided in xref:security-testing.adoc[Security Testing].

== More about security features in Quarkus

=== Cross-origin resource sharing

To make your Quarkus application accessible to another application running on a different domain, you need to configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
For more information about the CORS filter that is provided by Quarkus, see the xref:http-reference.adoc#cors-filter[HTTP reference] information.

=== Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention

Quarkus Security provides a RESTEasy Reactive filter that can protect your applications against a https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf[Cross-Site Request Forgery] attack.
For more information, see xref:security-csrf-prevention.adoc[Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention].

=== SameSite cookies

You can add a https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite[SameSite] cookie property to any of the cookies set by a Quarkus endpoint.
For more information, see xref:http-reference.adoc#same-site-cookie[SameSite cookies].

=== Secret engines
Secrets engines are components that store, generate, or encrypt data.

Quarkus provides comprehensive HashiCorp Vault support.
For more information, see the link:{vault-guide}[Quarkus and HashiCorp Vault] documentation.

=== Secure serialization

If your Quarkus Security architecture includes RESTEasy Reactive and Jackson, Quarkus can limit the fields that are included in JSON serialization based on the configured security.
For more information, see xref:resteasy-reactive.adoc#secure-serialization[Writing REST services with RESTEasy Reactive].

=== Secure auto-generated resources by REST Data with Panache

If you're using the REST Data with Panache extension to auto-generate your resources, you can still use the Security annotations within the package `javax.annotation.security`.
For more information, see xref:rest-data-panache.adoc#securing-endpoints[Securing auto-generated resources].

=== US National Vulnerability Database registration

Most of the Quarkus tags are registered in the US link:https://nvd.nist.gov[National Vulnerability Database] (NVD) in Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) name format.
To view the registered Quarkus CPE names, use link:https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe/search/results?namingFormat=2.3&keyword=quarkus[this search query].

If the NVE database flags a CVE against a Quarkus tag, a link that provides more details about the CVE is added to the given CPE name entry.

The NVD CPE team updates the list regularly, but if you encounter a false positive, report the details by creating an issue in the link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/2611[quarkusio] repository.

You can detect the vulnerabilities at the application build time with an NVD feed by using the Maven link:https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-maven/[OWASP Dependency check plugin].


To add the OWASP Dependency check plugin to your Quarkus Maven project, add the following XML configuration to the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
    <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
    <version>${owasp-dependency-check-plugin.version}</version>
</plugin>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Set the `owasp-dependency-check-plugin.version` value to `7.4.4` or later.
====

Next, configure the plugin as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.owasp</groupId>
    <artifactId>dependency-check-maven</artifactId>
    <version>${owasp-dependency-check-plugin.version}</version>
    <configuration>
        <!-- Fail only when detecting High Vulnerability issues -->
        <failBuildOnCVSS>7</failBuildOnCVSS>
        <suppressionFiles>
            <suppressionFile>${project.basedir}/dependency-cpe-suppression.xml</suppressionFile>
        </suppressionFiles>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

To detect less severe issues, adjust the value of `failBuildOnCVSS` to suppress the false positives, as demonstrated in the following code sample:
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<suppressions xmlns="https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-suppression.1.2.xsd">
    <!--
        This is a CPE suppression file for the maven dependency check plugin.
        Each CPE that is found by error (false positive) needs to be suppressed for a specific jar using its' GAV.
        See https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/suppression.html
     -->

Ensure that you review and update the suppression list regularly to ensure that the results are up to date.
You can optionally apply a time limit to individual suppressions by adding an expiry attribute, as outlined in the following example:

`<suppress until="2022-01-01Z">...</suppress>`
You can adjust the expiry date if you need to.
