# Target Generation Issue - Final Analysis

## Problem
Despite updating `TargetGenerationService.java` to use TypeScript batch executor `@nx-quarkus/maven-plugin:maven-batch`, the generated targets still show:
- Executor: `nx:run-commands`  
- Command: `java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* NxMavenBatchExecutor...`

## Critical Discovery
Added debug statement `System.err.println("CREATING GOAL TARGET WITH TYPESCRIPT EXECUTOR...")` to `createGoalTarget()` method.
**No output appears** - confirming the method is NOT being called during target generation.

## Evidence
1. ✅ Java code correctly updated with TypeScript executor
2. ✅ Code compiles successfully  
3. ✅ Exception test proved method not called
4. ❌ Debug statements never appear
5. ❌ Targets still generated with old format

## Root Cause
The `TargetGenerationService.createGoalTarget()` method we've been modifying is **NOT** the actual code path used for target generation. There's an alternative implementation or cached version being used.

## Next Steps
Find the actual target generation code path that's producing these targets with `nx:run-commands` executor.
