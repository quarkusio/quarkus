= Quarkus - Building a Native Executable

include::./attributes.adoc[]

This guide covers:

* Compiling the application to a native executable
* The packaging of the application in a container

This guide takes as input the application developed in the link:getting-started-guide.html[Getting Started Guide].

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* GraalVM installed from the http://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[GraalVM web site].
Using the community edition is enough.
Version {graalvm-version} is required.
* The `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable configured appropriately
* The `native-image` tool must be installed; this can be done by running `gu install native-image` from your GraalVM
directory
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* A working C developer environment (see the note below for details)
* A running Docker
* The code of the application developed in the link:getting-started-guide.html[Getting Started Guide].

[NOTE]
====
Once you have downloaded GraalVM, expand the archive and set the `GRAALVM_HOME` variable to this location:

`export GRAALVM_HOME=$HOME/Development/graalvm/`

On MacOS, point the variable to the `Home` sub-directory:

`export GRAALVM_HOME=$HOME/Development/graalvm/Contents/Home/`
====

[NOTE]
====
What does having a working C developer environment mean?

 * On Linux, you will need GCC, the glibc and zlib headers (on common distributions: `sudo dnf install gcc glibc-devel zlib-devel` or `sudo apt-get install build-essential libz-dev`).
 * On macOS, execute `xcode-select --install`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Some previous releases of GraalVM included the `native-image` tool by default.  This is no longer the
case; it now has to be installed as a second step after GraalVM itself is installed.  Use `gu install native-image`
to do so.
====

[TIP]
====
If you cannot install GraalVM, you can use a multi-stage Docker build to run Maven inside a Docker container that embeds GraalVM. There is an explanation of how to do this at the end of this guide.
====

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and package the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `getting-started` directory.

== Producing a native executable

Let's now produce a native executable for our application.
It improves the startup time of the application, and produces a minimal disk footprint.
The executable would have everything to run the application including the "JVM" (shrunk to be just enough to run the application), and the application.

image:native-executable-process.png[Creating a native executable]

Before going further, be sure that the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable is configured appropriately.

If you have generated the application from the previous tutorial, you can find in the `pom.xml` the following _profile_:

[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>native</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
                    <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>${quarkus.version}</version>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>native-image</goal>
                            </goals>
                            <configuration>
                                <enableHttpUrlHandler>true</enableHttpUrlHandler>
                            </configuration>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>
----

[TIP]
====
You can provide additional options for `native-image` command using `<additionalBuildArgs>foo,bar</additionalBuildArgs>`
configuration element. Provided options have to be `,` separated.
====

We use a profile because, you will see very soon, packaging the native executable takes a _few_ seconds.

Create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

In addition to the regular files, the build also produces `target/getting-started-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.
You can run it using: `./target/getting-started-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.

== Testing the native executable

Producing a native executable can lead to a few issues, and so it's also a good idea to run some tests against the application running in the native file.

In the `pom.xml` file, the `native` profile contains:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${surefire-plugin.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>integration-test</goal>
                <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <systemProperties>
                    <native.image.path>${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}-runner</native.image.path>
                </systemProperties>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

This instructs the failsafe-maven-plugin to run integration-test and indicates the location of the produced native executable.

Then, open the `src/test/java/org/acme/quickstart/NativeGreetingResourceIT.java`. It contains:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.quickstart;


import io.quarkus.test.junit.SubstrateTest;

@SubstrateTest // <1>
public class NativeGreetingResourceIT extends GreetingResourceTest { // <2>

    // Run the same tests

}
----
<1> Use another test runner that starts the application from the native file before the tests.
The executable is retrieved using the `native.image.path` system property configured in the _Failsafe Maven Plugin_.
<2> We extend our previous tests, but you can also implement your tests

To see the `NativeGreetingResourceIT` run against the native executable, use `./mvnw verify -Pnative`:
[source,shell]
----
./mvnw verify -Pnative

[TIP]
====
By default, Quarkus waits for 60 seconds for the native image to start before automatically failing the native tests. This
duration can be changed using the `quarkus.test.native-image-wait-time` system property. For example, to increase the duration
to 300 seconds, use: `./mvnw verify -Pnative -Dquarkus.test.native-image-wait-time=300`.
====

=== Excluding tests when running as a native executable

When running tests this way, the only things that actually run natively are you application endpoints, which
you can only test via HTTP calls. Your test code does not actually run natively, so if you are testing code
that does not call your HTTP endpoints, it's probably not a good idea to run them as part of native tests.

If you share your test class between JVM and native executions like we advise above, you can mark certain tests
with the `@DisabledOnSubstrate` annotation in order to only run them on the JVM.

== Creating a container

IMPORTANT: Before going further, be sure to have a working container runtime (Docker, podman) environment.

You can run the application in a container using the JAR produced by the Quarkus Maven Plugin.
However, in this guide we focus on creating a container image using the produced native executable.

image:containerization-process.png[Containerization Process]

By default, the native executable is tailored for your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows etc).
Because the container may not use the same _executable_ format as the one produced by your operating system,
we will instruct the Maven build to produce an executable from inside a container:

[source, shell]
----
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dnative-image.docker-build=true
----

[TIP]
====
You can also select the container runtime to use with:
[source,shell]
----
# Docker
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dnative-image.container-runtime=docker
# Podman
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dnative-image.container-runtime=podman
----
====

The produced executable will be a 64 bit Linux executable, so depending on your operating system it may no longer be runnable.
However, it's not an issue as we are going to copy it to a container.
The project generation has provided a `Dockerfile.native` in the `src/main/docker` directory with the following content:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY target/*-runner /work/application
RUN chmod 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

Then, if you didn't delete the generated native executable, you can build the docker image with:

[source,shell]
----
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t quarkus-quickstart/getting-started .
----

And finally, run it with:

[source,shell]
----
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus-quickstart/getting-started
----

NOTE: Interested by tiny Docker images, check the {quarkus-images-url}/graalvm-{graalvm-version}/distroless[distroless] version.

== Creating a container with a multi-stage Docker build

The previous section showed you how to build a native executable using Maven, but implicitly required that the proper GraalVM version be installed on the building machine (be it your local machine or your CI/CD infrastructure).

In cases where the GraalVM requirement cannot be met, you can use Docker to perform the Maven build by using a multi-stage Docker build. A multi-stage Docker build is like two Dockerfile files combined in one, the first is used to build the artifact used by the second. 

In this guide we will use the first stage to generate the native executable using Maven and the second stage to create our runtime image.

[source,dockerfile,subs=attributes+]
----
## Stage 1 : build with maven builder image with native capabilities
FROM quay.io/quarkus/centos-quarkus-maven:{graalvm-version} AS build
COPY src /usr/src/app/src
COPY pom.xml /usr/src/app
USER root
RUN chown -R quarkus /usr/src/app
USER quarkus
RUN mvn -f /usr/src/app/pom.xml -Pnative clean package

## Stage 2 : create the docker final image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/target/*-runner /work/application
RUN chmod 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----


Save this file in `src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage` as it is not included in the getting started quickstart.

[WARNING]
====
Before launching our Docker build, we need to update the default `.dockerignore` file as it filters everything except the `target` directory and as we plan to build inside a container we need to be able to copy the `src` directory. So edit your `.dockerignore` and remove or comment its content.
====

[source,shell]
----
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage -t quarkus-quickstart/getting-started .
----

And finally, run it with:

[source,shell]
----
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus-quickstart/getting-started
----

[TIP]
====
If you need SSL support in your native executable, you can easily include the necessary libraries in your Docker image.

Please see link:native-and-ssl-guide.html#working-with-containers[our Using SSL With Native Executables guide] for more information.
====

== What's next?

This guide covered the creation of a native (binary) executable for your application.
It provides an application exhibiting a swift startup time and consuming less memory.
However, there is much more.
We recommend continuing the journey with the link:kubernetes-guide.html[deployment to Kubernetes and OpenShift].
