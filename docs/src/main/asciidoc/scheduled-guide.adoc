= {project-name} - Schedule Periodic Tasks

Modern applications often need to run specific tasks periodically.
In this guide, you learn how to schedule periodic tasks.

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 10 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+

Remember, you need to configure Maven as indicated in the link:maven-config.html[Maven configuration page].

== Architecture

In this guide, we create a straightforward application accessible using HTTP to get the current value of a counter.
This counter is periodically (every 10 seconds) incremented.

== Solution

We recommend you to follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone https://github.com/protean-project/quickstarts.git`, or download an https://github.com/protean-project/quickstarts/archive/master.zip[archive].

The solution is located in the `scheduling-periodic-task` directory.

== Creating the Maven project

First, we need a new project. Create a new project with the following command:

[source, subs=attributes+]
----
mvn org.jboss.shamrock:shamrock-maven-plugin:{shamrock-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=scheduling-periodic-tasks \
    -DclassName="org.acme.scheduling.CountResource" \
    -Dpath="/count" \
    -Dextensions="scheduler"
----

It generates:

* the Maven structure
* a landing page accessible on `http://localhost:8080`
* an example of `Dockerfile`
* the application configuration file
* an `org.acme.scheduling.CountResource` resource
* an associated test

The Maven project also imports the Shamrock scheduler extension.

== Creating a scheduled job

In the `org.acme.scheduling` package, create the `CounterBean` class, with the following content:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.scheduling;

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.jboss.shamrock.scheduler.api.Scheduled;

@ApplicationScoped              // <1>
public class CounterBean {

    private AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();

    public int get() {
        return counter.get();
    }

    @Scheduled(every="10s")     // <2>
    void increment() {
        counter.incrementAndGet();
    }

}
----
1. Declare the bean in the _application_ scope
2. Use the `@Scheduled` annotation to instruct Shamrock to runs this method every 10 seconds

The code is pretty straightforward. Every 10 seconds, the counter is incremented.
The `get()` method allows retrieving the current value.

NOTE: Cron-like expressions are also supported. The syntax is currently based on http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.x/tutorials/crontrigger.html[Quartz Cron Trigger, window="_blank"]. For example a method annotated with `@Scheduled(cron="0 15 10 * * ?")` is executed at 10:15am every day.

== Updating the resource and the test


Edit the `CountResource` class, and update the content to:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme.scheduling;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/count")
public class CountResource {

    @Inject
    CounterBean counter;            // <1>


    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "count: " + counter.get();  // <2>
    }
}
----
1. Inject the `CounterBean`
2. Send back the current counter value

We also need to update the tests. Edit the `CountResourceTest` class to match:

[source, java]
----
package org.acme.scheduling;

import org.jboss.shamrock.test.junit.ShamrockTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.containsString;;

@ShamrockTest
public class CountResourceTest {

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
          .when().get("/count")
          .then()
             .statusCode(200)
             .body(containsString("count")); // <1>
    }

}
----
1. Ensure that the response contains `count`

== Package and run the application

Run the application with: `mvn compile shamrock:dev`.
In another terminal, run `curl localhost:8080/count` to check the counter value.
After a few seconds, re-run `curl localhost:8080/count` to verify the counter has been incremented.

As usual, the application can be packaged using `mvn clean package` and executed using the `-runner.jar` file.
You can also generate the native executable.
